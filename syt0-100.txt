Basketball-Lenny Aglaé selected for Fiba Europe coaching certificate programme
31-July-2013

Head coach of the female Juniors team, Aglaé will be among 60 coaches to attend three coaching clinics over a period of two years. The clinics are always organised in conjunction with the European Youth Championships with an examination part as the final element.
The first clinic will run from August 11-19 alongside the Under-16 European Championship for men division A. The second will be in 2014 during the Under-18 European Championship for men division A and the third in 2015 during the Under-20 European Championship for men division A.
The purpose of organising the clinics in line with the European championships is to monitor the development of the young players over a period of two years and in three major competitions.
Aglaé received his plane ticket this week from Seychelles Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association (Socga) president Antonio Gopal in the presence of other Socga executive committee members and representatives of the Seychelles Basketball Federation. The plane ticket has been sponsored by the Olympic Solidarity.
“I feel proud and privileged to get the opportunity to follow such a coaching course. It’s a big achievement and is one of the dreams. Now I have to make the most of the opportunity given to me,” Aglaé, 42, told Sports Nation.
The coaches nominated for this programme will:
. Gain a competent level of knowledge of European youth basketball (identification of players),
. Get high quality coach clinics (development of players),
. Secure top level education for young talents,
. Gain a reputable coaching qualification with great references, and
. The certified coaches will bring their knowledge back home and in turn raise national coaching standards.
The Fiba Europe coaching certificate curriculum has been developed by some of the best known coaching experts in youth basketball and the programme’s mentor is Svetislav Pesic, who is widely recognised as one of the most successful coaches in Europe and the world.
Pesic won the European title with Germany (in 1993) and Yugoslavia (in 2001) and the world championship title with Yugoslavia (in 2002). He was also a Euro League winner as player and coach and was coach of the year in Europe in 2003.
Other coaches include Janez Drvaric, Pablo Laso, Lucien Legrand, Kostas Missas, Nihat Izic, Aysim Altay and Sasa Jakovljevic.

Volleyball-Wong shocked by CAVB award
31-July-2013

He received the glass trophy from CAVB technical official, Mauritian Kaysee Teeroovengadum on Saturday at the Palais des Sports during the Africa zone seven sub-zonal 2014 FIVB World Championship qualifiers.
Sports Nation caught up with Mr Wong and he was almost lost for words when asked to comment on this award.
“I’m a bit shocked but also happy to receive this award. The interesting thing is that sometimes people from outside can better appreciate what one has to offer,” reflected the Seychelles Volleyball Federation (SVF) executive committee member.
Mr Wong has been a stalwart in sports administration and organisation here, leaving his legacy by being the commissioner of the Indian Ocean Island Games in 1993 which were described as a great success.
The former player and coach though told Sports Nation that this award is due to his vast contribution in the zone seven committee for quite a while.
“I would like to think that I have contributed to make zone seven a solid committee as well as bring them together. On many occasions I have run the show at these competitions,” said the St Louis resident who hails from La Digue.
Mr Wong added that his technical knowledge of sports has also helped a lot towards zone seven where he has helped this grouping on several occasions.
“One of the highlights of my time with the zone seven is the hosting of the Indian Ocean club competition in 2008 where we organised an almost perfect competition as the SVF ensured everything ran smoothly,” noted the veteran sports personality.
Mr Wong also said he even took over the running of the same competition in Mauritius once and everyone was happy with the level of organisation.
“I have helped a lot in the development of this sport in zone seven as I was there at the start and despite not being a federation chairman, I was put on the committee until two years ago when I stepped down. But I have always been instrumental in organising its competitions,” the former physical education coordinator in schools said in conclusion.
Sports Nation would like to congratulate Mr Wong on his achievement and hopes he continues to share his wide experience in sports development here.

Supreme Court building should house History Museum
31-July-2013
The building and grounds of the old Law Courts would be a fitting setting to showcase the history of Seychelles, and the proposed swap deserves serious consideration by the person or committee responsible for the final decision.

Letter to the Editor-Supreme Court building exudes History Museum
31-July-2013
The Law Courts Building, as the Supreme Court building is officially known under our law, has seen a glorious past and from all accounts it was the architectural showpiece of Victoria for over 100 years, modified over the years while being occupied by the judiciary. As the home to the History Museum it will be guarded by Pierre Poivre and Queen Victoria with the Clock Tower, Liberty House (formerly, Queen’s Building) and the Carnegie Building as its neighbours; placing it at the very centre of historical Victoria with whose history it is inextricably linked.
I hope Mr Georges’ suggestion is taken up and the building is also restored to its original state. For instance in order to accommodate the expansion of the judiciary over the years, the balconies facing Francis Rachel Street (formerly Victoria Street) and the Pirates Arms Restaurant were both separated in two, while its exterior in terms of the colour scheme had undergone some changes.
I am sure restoring the balconies to their true lengths and the exterior of the building to its original colour scheme will give this building its former splendour.
Yes, Mr Georges, you are right, the building does exude History Museum!

Round Table Seychelles hosts picnic for orphans
31-July-2013

The picnic is part of the organisation’s community projects and Miss Seychelles Agnes Gerry and her second princess Isha Hoareau were also present for the day.
Those who were passing by the beach would have thought that it was the Regatta, with Round Table Seychelles tents and flags on display.
There were in total 97 children from the different orphanages.
Speaking to Seychelles Nation, Vincent Lee Kim Koon, chairperson of Round Table Seychelles No. 2 (SRT2), said they decided to organise this picnic in July as different organisations host different activities for the children.

“As the sea at Beau Vallon is calm during the month of July we thought it would be perfect for such an activity,” Mr Lee Kim Koon said.
The activity has cost the SRT2 approximately R30,000.
Mr Lee Kim Koon took the opportunity to thank the other organisations that helped in organising the picnic. He also thanked the volunteers who are always willing to help.
The children were able to impersonate different characters as they got their face painted in the face painting activity. They laughed with joy as they enjoyed themselves on the bouncy castle. They even played different kinds of game such as the traditional lapi lapon, beach football with Miss Seychelles Agnes Gerry and her second princess Isha Hoareau.

After a day full of fun the children returned to their respective homes with their hands full after receiving presents from Miss Gerry and Miss Hoareau.
The accompanying photos show the children having fun in the different activities organised for them on the day.

The National Curriculum Framework-Supporting a new vision for learning
31-July-2013
The NCF has been developed by a team of curriculum developers with the assistance of a
local consultant in collaboration with educators, teachers, parents, employers and the wider community.  Numerous consultations have been an important part of the process in order to ensure that the NCF reflects the needs and aspirations of our society while at the same time considering the global challenges.

Prior to the launching of the finally document, the last consultation meeting took place on May 15, 2013 with the participation of various key education partners, including members of the National Assembly, representatives from other ministries, head teachers, school councils, students, National Qualification Authority, Tertiary Education Commission and NGOs.

This week’s Education Page brings you a feature article with more information on what the National Curriculum Framework entails.
The National Curriculum
Learning and teaching are the core business of schools and the curriculum is central to this process. The term ‘curriculum’ refers to a dynamic concept that may vary in scope and content depending on the context in which it is used.  In the context of Seychelles ‘the curriculum’ means the intended learning expected of all students, the learning environment, the resources, teaching strategies and approaches, assessment processes and methods, all interlinked with the values and ethos of the school, the relationships and behaviour among students, teachers, school leaders and parents.  It also encompasses the ‘hidden curriculum’ which comes between the intended, experienced and achieved curriculum. Clearly the curriculum is much broader than a syllabus which only provides an outline of what is to be taught.
About The National Curriculum Framework (2013)
The National Curriculum Framework has three major components:
• The policies governing the National Curriculum, and guidelines necessary for its implementation, contained in this document: The Seychelles National Curriculum – a framework for learning and teaching (2013).
• The expected learning outcomes of each essential learning area in terms of subject content and achievement standards describing what students are typically able to understand and do at each key stage. These are to be found in a series of curriculum documents describing each of the essential learning areas such as ‘Mathematics in the National Curriculum’, ‘Science in the National Curriculum’, ‘The Arts in the National Curriculum’, etc.
• Achievement objectives in terms of knowledge, skills and understanding for each subject, contained in programmes of study.
Rationale for the National Curriculum Framework
The National Curriculum Framework 2013 replaces the National Curriculum Framework of 2001. While building on the strengths of the latter, the present framework takes into account the views and experiences of learners, schools and educators over a decade, along with changes that are taking place within our society and globally.

The National Curriculum Framework provides a basis for planning for learning and teaching in all state schools. It establishes the principles and values to guide curriculum planning and implementation. It outlines the essential competencies and life skills necessary for the development of successful lifelong learners who will become active and responsible citizens.
Aims, goals and objectives of the NCF
The Seychelles National Curriculum Framework presents the official policy for curriculum in all state schools. Adherence to it is therefore mandatory. The NCF sets the national direction for learning and provides guidance for schools in the review and design of their curricula.

The goals of the NCF are to provide a coherent framework for the planning and delivery of school curricula and to ensure consistency and balance between the intended, experienced and achieved curricula.
Its main objectives are to:
- Establish the principles on which decisions regarding school curriculum are based.
- Indicate the values that are important to education and are to be encouraged and modelled.
- Establish the essential competencies and skills needed for successful lifelong learning.
-Outline the educational outcomes to be achieved by all students at the different stages of the schooling process and in each of the learning areas of the national curriculum.
-Guide the development of achievement standards at each key stage, for the different learning areas.
- Provide guidance on assessment and reporting of students’ achievements.
- Provide guidelines for curriculum implementation in all state schools.
-Provide guidance on parental and community involvement.

Principles
Nine principles guide the implementation of the school curriculum. They apply in particular to the processes of school curriculum planning, prioritising, teaching and review, and they are focused on students and on learning. They should help schools determine what is important and desirable in curriculum planning and delivery; all curriculum should be consistent with the following statements: 

1. Entitlement to high standards of education
2. Learner-centred learning
3. Inclusion
4. Curriculum coherence
5. Parent and community engagement
6. Education for sustainability
7. Quality assurance
8. Leadership for effective learning
9. Teacher and school support
Progression and key stages
The national curriculum is for all state schools and it is designed for all students. It is considered as one single framework for learning and development from 3½ to 16+ years. 
Since children and young people progress at different rates over time, the curriculum is designed to allow for such progression in their achievements. Thus the national curriculum specifies five key stages to indicate the different levels and rates of progress students can achieve in learning. They serve as signposts to help us establish clear and high expectations of progress and attainment.
 
CR: Creche, P: Primary, S: Secondary, Yr: Year
Essential learning areas
The essential learning areas of the national curriculum are guided by and derived from the principles and values described earlier.
Learning areas are broader than subjects. They usually comprise a number of related subjects which can lead to different levels of specialisation as students progress through learning.
The National Curriculum Framework specifies nine essential learning areas which, combined with the values, essential competencies and skills described here, help students acquire the necessary knowledge and understanding, skills, attitudes and values that will enable them to become successful lifelong learners and to develop the capacities and values to be active and responsible citizens.
They are: 
- Languages
-Mathematics
- The Arts 
- Sciences
- Technical and Vocational Education
- Social Sciences
- Personal, Social and Citizenship Education
- Health and Physical Education
- Information and Communication Technology
All nine learning areas contribute to a balanced curriculum and are essential for a broad and general education.

VP Faure receives copy of electoral reform report
31-July-2013

Also present were Electoral Commission members Marie- Thérèse Purvis, Gerard Lafortune and Beatty Hoareau.
The report and recommendations of the Electoral Reform in Seychelles has been made at the request of the government of Seychelles in October 2011 to amend the Elections Act.
The Electoral Reform Forum which included the Electoral Commission, representative of all political parties, one representative from the Attorney General’s office and Citizens Democracy Watch, representing Seychelles civil society, worked on the report and recommendations on electoral reform in Seychelles.


************************************


Commission presents report and recommendations on electoral reform
31-July-2013
This was done at the National House yesterday afternoon in the presence of the media and representatives of political parties, just after a copy of the document was presented to Vice-President Danny Faure at State House.
Vice-President Faure was representing President James Michel who is currently out of the country.
The report and recommendations follow two years of deliberations by the Forum of Electoral Reform composed of members of the Electoral Commission, political party representatives, the civil society represented by the Citizens’ Democracy Watch and a representative from the Attorney General.
This came after the Electoral Commission was mandated by government in July 2011 to enshrine acceptable modern democratic laws in the electoral laws of Seychelles.
The Electoral Commission has also benefitted from public consultations as well as help from the Commonwealth and has relied on international good practices and conventions and treaties on individual and political rights in order to come out with the final recommendations.
Electoral Commission chairperson Hendrick Gappy said that among other recommendations the most important ones cover three main components: The Elections Act, Campaign and Financing Act, and the Party Registration Act.
Under the Elections Act, it is being proposed that a voters’ census be carried out in order to update the present voters’ list which the Electoral Commission feels lacks credibility.
The commission is also in favour of a continuous voters’ registration system whereby the register remains open all year round for consultation and registration and changes to it can be made at any time.
The three-day ‘cooling off period’ prior to elections has also been reviewed. As no reference to it appears in the Constitution, it is proposed that it will no longer be referred to as such. In its place, the Electoral Commission is proposing that campaigning activities, such as door to door visits, can be done within 24 hours before the elections. However, aggressive campaigning in the form of motorcades, public meetings, parties, and political broadcasts will not be permitted during that period.
The issue of assisted voting has also been addressed and it is now proposed that a voter who needs help in order to cast his/her vote be accompanied in the voters’ booth by two electoral officers instead of a relative, friend or party representative as it has been customary up to now.
A major change proposed under this act is that in case the president dies or resigns, fresh elections must be organised within a 90-day period. This differs to present provisions whereby the president can transfer power to the vice-president.
In the spirit of transparency, changes in the Party Registration Act call for disclosure and publication of all financing and donations in favour of political parties. The amendments propose a limit on financing but at the same time provide for the creation of a Political Parties Financial Support Fund to finance the day-to-day running of all registered political parties.
The report and recommendations on electoral reform in Seychelles adds to recommendations on the revision of the Public Order Act which the Electoral Commission presented to government in September 2012.
According to the Commission, the government had wished to study the full set of recommendations as one document before sending them to the Attorney General’s office for drafting of appropriate bill prior to approval by the National Assembly.
The Electoral Commission has expressed the wish to see the process through and the recommendations transformed into law as soon as possible so that it can implement the changes in time for the next elections due in 2016.

Nisa launches more dynamic website
31-July-2013

Compared to the current one, this new-look website – which can still be accessed at www.nation.sc – offers viewers a totally different browsing and reading experience, more human interaction and much more interesting and informative contents.
“The previous website has been around for some years now. Therefore, there was a need to bring about a modern look to the site,” says Nisa’s chief executive Merline Volcère.
“This involved coming up with a modern new façade for the website for improved visibility, creating a user friendly menu that would facilitate web-page navigation, publishing commercially oriented feature articles and creating more space for banner advertising clients,” says Ms Volcère.
“In fact, the ultimate aim was to have both the visual aspect and the editorial content of the website upgraded. The refurbished look would entice customers while the more informative and interactive content is designed to keep the customers updated about the latest in terms of published articles,” adds the chief executive.
Noting that Nisa has a well-established customer liaison network that enables its customers to freely communicate their views and comments concerning published items, Ms Volcère says over the recent years, the agency has compiled all the suggestions and views of its clients concerning the various deficiencies of its previous website.
“Management has tabulated and discussed all these comments, and has consequently strategised on the different ways in which the customers’ request could be accommodated and considered in the new website project,” says Ms Volcère.
Noting that training has always been a priority at Nisa, Ms Volcère says the agency has found it necessary to invest in training of its staff so that they would be in a better position to manage and maintain the website to the required standard.
“At Nisa we are always striving to do everything in-house with the aim of imparting various skills to our staff. There is extensive work flexibility when our own people are managing the site. The website itself is a dynamic tool. Enabling our own staff to have a hands-on approach to the ongoing changes to the website allows us to exercise proper control over the day-to-day business activity of the site,” the chief executive says.
On the topic of online advertising, Ms Volcère says that due to technological globalisation, inevitably advertising industry is shifting to the on-line medium. Therefore, in order to remain in the game, this new website is allowing Nisa to take its first leap into the world of online advertising.
“Our background research has revealed that there is indeed a market in Seychelles for online advertising and we want to be among those businesses that would tap into this market,” she says.
“In a nutshell, Nisa is maintaining its flexibility to shift the focus of its business operations towards areas of greater return on investment. This strategic decision allows us to fulfill the objective of maintaining a profitable and sustainable public entity,” she adds.
Ms Volcère believes there will be high expectations from all quarters concerning the new Nisa website.
“Nisa is aware that its esteemed clients are expecting a higher standard of published items on the site and is determined to ensure that its customers are satisfied,” says the chief executive.
“At Nisa we are also expecting our customers to respond positively to the various aspects of the new website, that is both the editorial and the advert sections,” she adds.
What makes the new www.nation.sc more innovative is that apart from the daily fresh news retrieved from the newspaper and input everyday as has been the case with the current website, a larger variety of contents have been added under the Feature News.
Feature news is all about ‘the news behind the fresh news’ – news that are written in a more detailed format; news that form part of our daily lives but which are being overlooked, not being talked about or written like the normal daily news stories.
Topics covered fall under such menus as President Michel, Lifestyle, Business, Health, Living, Agrinews, Tourism, Environment, Culture, National Assembly, etc… but with an extra element added to them to differentiate them from the normal everyday news.
 
The FEATURE news menus will be flexible as fresh topics will be included every now and then depending on the news trends.
An example of such feature stories on the new www.nation.sc is a round-up of events that have occurred, agreements signed and projects realised between Sri Lanka and Seychelles less than a year after President James Michel’s official visit to Colombo. The culmination of this topic is the three-day returned visit by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa early last July.
Also featured under such menu are some points of reflections on President Michel’s National Day address on June 18 this year.
Other lighter topics also feature under our Lifestyle or Living menus. Were you aware that the use of debit cards in Seychelles is in vogue now and are being used by ordinary citizens? Lots of locals are either booking hotel rooms overseas or ordering merchandises online like clothes, spare parts and other goods. Were you aware that lots of locals are paying for purchases in shops through debit cards? People are carrying less money around as they are now ‘swiping’ their cards in supermarkets and other shops. Read more under Lifestyle – ‘The rise of the debit card in Seychelles’.
Know more on the Roman Catholic’s ‘Journée Mondiale de la Jeunesse’ which just recently held their youth festival in Rio de Janeiro hosted by Pope Francis.
Senpa (Small Enterprise Promotion Agency) is an entity that is being given prominence on the new Seychelles NATION website where on a monthly basis one or two small businesses feature in a bid to provide them with more publicity. There are about 2236 registered small business in Seychelles in sectors like art & craft, tailoring, handicraft, repairs & maintenance, manufacturing, food processing, upholstery, horticulture, professional services, etc…. More on the new www.nation.sc under the Business Extra menu.
Online advertising is another new field being explored by Nisa and its new website.  As research has shown, more and more consumers are relying on accessing information via the web; advertising on a website is a great way to be seen or target your necessary audience. The new www.nation.sc is offering potential clients very attractive rates for advertising there. The website also offers paid links to a client’s own website hence driving traffic to your website through our viewers.
Another aspect of the revamped Seychelles NATION website  which will surely attract more human interaction is our games corners where we have allowed space for viewers to ‘Play with Nation’ or Online games. As a start-up the ‘Play with NATION’ module is related to the newspaper itself and it will later feature other games with local themes such as ‘Dekouver ou Pei’, test your knowledge on local personalities, dignitaries or events worth remembering or worth mentioning, as well as the flora and fauna of Seychelles.
Every webpage of the new website has a Comment Section at the bottom where viewers can express their views or suggestions. Again this is another means of making our viewers interact more with the digital newspaper.
Log on to the new www.nation.sc as from tomorrow and enjoy the experience.

Oil exploration in Seychelles-Drilling set to start end of next year
31-July-2013
VP Faure said Seychelles currently has agreements with two oil companies to carry out oil explorations here. 
Afren, a London-based oil and natural gas exploration company, is in the process of collecting and gathering all the necessary data and is moving forward with the drilling scheduled for the last quarter of next year.
Meanwhile, Mr Faure explained that the other company – Australian energy company WHL Energy Limited, which is in principle in the second phase of exploration and should start drilling in the first quarter of next year -- is encountering some constraints and has informed Petro Seychelles.
According to information the government has received, representatives of the company are expected in the country in the coming two weeks to explain its position to the government.
Minister Faure gave these details while answering a question by elected member for Grand Anse Mahé Lenny Lebon.
He had asked VP Faure for an update on the oil exploration activities.
Asked if there are any other oil companies which have been expressing interest in oil exploration here and if there are any countries which have offered Seychelles help in the oil exploration process, VP Faure explained that once government signs an agreement with a company this proves that it has all indications that the company has agreed to carry out the work as per their agreement.
Mr Faure explained that having a licence does not mean having an agreement and there are many companies with interests in East Africa which have approached Petro Seychelles and have expressed their interest in oil exploration here.
He said there are also governments which are currently in talks with the Seychelles authorities, adding that the Japanese government has been showing a keen interest in taking part and bringing along its expertise in the process.
With regard to government’s transparency in providing timely and updated information to the public on the ongoing process relating to any oil exploration, Mr Faure explained that the government’s position on the issue is clear.
“In line with that, the Ministry of Finance, Trade and Investment through its negotiations with the World Bank recently issued a declaration stating that Seychelles is ready to follow all transparency regulations if ever oil is discovered here,” added VP Faure.
In another question, Mr Lebon asked Mr Faure about the government’s plans in the event that oil is discovered here.
Mr Faure said the government has for the past years been fine-tuning its plan and is aware of its weaknesses and is working with different organisations so as to avoid mistakes committed by countries where oil has been discovered.
“Oil discovery can be a blessing as well as a curse for a country and our plan is centred on making a possible discovery a blessing for our country. In order to make that happen we need a ‘robust plan’ and this is why Petro Seychelles has developed good relations with the Commonwealth secretariat to work on our relating laws and regulations as well as supporting institutions to ensure that the plan is a strong one,” added VP Faure.
He also said Seychelles has learned a lot from the Norwegian government through its sovereign fund which is a model being followed by many countries especially on the aspect of environment protection.
Furthermore, Mr Faure noted that the finance ministry and its partners such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are also providing support to upgrade and review the Seychelles Revenue Commission in preparation to manage oil revenues.
“A special trust to manage oil revenues will be set for that purpose to ensure a better future for Seychelles and its people,” Mr Faure explained. 
Meanwhile, VP Faure informed the Assembly that work is ongoing to review the laws and regulations to bring  them up to date so they could meet the demands of the ongoing process in preparation for future oil explorations here while  amendments to other regulations will be considered if the need arises in the future .

Basketball: National League-Baya hand Heat second defeat, Hawks crush Drifters
30-July-2013
The game of the weekend was surely the top-of-table clash between Baya and leaders Beau Vallon Heat at Victoria Gymnasium on Sunday.
Robert Léon (Beau Vallon Heat) and Timmy Adam (Baya) provided the early spark for their teams, scoring 9 and 8 points respectively in the first quarter during which Baya edged ahead 19-15.
 
Heat attempted to fight back in the second quarter and managed to cut their opponents’ lead to three points – 33-30 – at the end of 20 minutes of play.
Baya really showed their domination in the third and fourth quarters. They opened up a 16-point lead by the end of the third quarter – 58-42 – as they outscored the Heat 25-12. Coach Michel Malbrook’s players pressed harder on the accelerator in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Heat 30-15 for an 88-57 win as they handed the Heat their second defeat in four second-round matches.
Timmy Adam led all scores with 23 points for Baya while Liston Reginald added 22 points including six 3-pointers. Former Baya centre Robert Léon led Beau Vallon Heat with 17 points.
Defending champions PLS Hawks kept their hopes of retaining the title alive with a crushing 114-37 victory over a Drifters side who are yet to win in three matches in the second round.
The Hawks got off to a flying start in the first quarter, scoring 26 compared to a lowly 3 points for Drifters. 
They carried their dominance into the remaining quarters which they won 32-9, 28-13 and 28-12 to subsequently win the game 114-37.
Nigerian Alao Solomon had the hot hands for the Hawks scoring 35 points while Ervin Agathine scored 15 for Drifters.
On Saturday, Mont Fleuri Dawgz met MBU Rockers at Victoria Gym and Ron Estico led the scoring with 20 points to help the Dawgz to a 73-56 win.
Daniel Hoareau and Nigel Sinon got 11 points apiece for the Rockers.
Meanwhile in the women’s league, the mother-daughter duo of Simone and Jana Malbrook combined for 31 points to lead Anse Etoile Stars to a 76-32 win against HotShots to maintain their 100 percent record this season.
Simone contributed 17 points while Jana added 14 for the Stars.

Volleyball: FIVB World Championships qualifiers – Africa zone 7, games three-Tough wins for Seychelles
30-July-2013
Sunday’s two matches at the Palais des Sports lasted a combined 3 hours 55 minutes and the Mauritians, especially the men’s team, came close to earning a victory.
Coached by former international Melchior Miniopoo, the Mauritians finally lost the five-setter after 2 hours 15 minutes of play, proving that Seychelles have to improve for the second phase of the zone seven qualifiers in Mauritius if they are to join the other 11 second-stage winners in the pool phase to vie for one of the three tickets to Poland for the men’s world champs.
Having won the first two games in straight sets – 3-0 (25-23, 25-13, 25-19) on Friday and 3-0 (25-20, 25-18, 25-19) on Saturday – the Seychelles men’s team, coached by James Camille, who led them to winning a second Indian Ocean Island Games gold medal in 2011 after a first title win in 1993, were pushed to the limit before winning the match 3-2 (25-22, 20-25, 25-21, 26-28, 15-13) against a Mauritian side boasting five players below 23 years old.
Seychelles’ youngest player is rapid attacker Rodney Ah-kong who plays for Rennes Volley 35 in the French Pro A, and the oldest being libero Perrin Sophola at 43 years old and who was a member of the two IOIG gold medal-winning sides in 1993 and 2011. Sophola has also represented Seychelles at six IOIG – in 1990 in Madagascar, in 1993 and 2011 in Seychelles, in 1998 in Reunion, in 2003 in Mauritius and in 2007 in Madagascar.
Sunday’s women’s match was also the longest of the three and Seychelles, under head coach Nichol Lesperance, still won 3-1 (25-22, 25-21, 20-25, 25-16) to maintain their domination over Mauritius after also winning game one on Friday 3-1 (22-25, 25-20, 25-14, 25-18) and game two on Saturday 3-0 (25-19, 25-23, 25-21).

Among the new faces of the Seychelles team is Petra Richard, who being the tallest at 1.87 metres and youngest at 18 years old, can become of the country’s top rapid attackers if given the right training and opportunity to play at the highest level.
Mauritius on the other hand, have eight players below 23 years old and coach Lindsay Wilson told Sports Nation that the more experienced players who did not make the trip to Seychelles will be available for selection ahead of the second stage of the qualifiers in Mauritius.
The zone seven second stage winners will join 11 other teams from Africa – one from zone 1 and two from zones 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 – where they will be drawn into two pools of six. The two pool winners will represent Africa at the women’s World Championships which will be contested by 24 teams in Italy.

Stop racism at football matches
30-July-2013
During a St Roch v/s Côte d’Or match earlier this season, one of the greatest local players this country has ever produced, Alpha Baldé (playing for St Roch at the time), was subject to racial slurs by a female supporter whereby he was constantly being called a ‘monkey’.
I spoke to Baldé and he confirmed that this incident did indeed happen and he stopped playing during that match to give that supporter a piece of his mind.

Baldé added that he was fed up of all this for this is how he has been treated by a few supporters throughout his career where he has never once been protected by the officials but has rather been sent off a few times for responding to these abuses. This, he said, is one of the reasons why he decided to stop playing competitively and rather have fun with beach football. I made a comment about this incident on my Facebook page back then where it became a highly debatable topic. One person even added that these sorts of incidents also occur at volleyball and basketball matches where still nothing is being done to punish the culprits.
A similar incident surfaced during our match (The Lions v/s Côte d’Or) on Saturday whereby racial comments (about his nationality) were also made about our Gabonese player Tony Mussikoue. This time by a male supporter. Our goalkeeping coach confronted this individual after the match telling him that this is not acceptable in sports.
I truly believe that clubs do everything possible to speak to their supporters but there will always be a minority who don’t care to listen. I also believe that many people don’t really know what racism means. Hence, I feel all clubs should join forces with the authorities to tackle this long-standing issue once and for all for we do not want to see a situation where players walk off the field like it is constantly happening in Italy. Let us kick racism out of our sports!

Football: Exclusive interview with Kevin Betsy-‘The only person who can stop you from achieving your dreams is yourself’
30-July-2013
  
The Kevin Betsy Foundation is a way to give back to the community
 
Kevin has recently founded the Kevin Betsy Foundation aimed at helping all Seychellois and
British kids develop their football skills and coaching in Seychelles. He has received the help of Suketu Patel to set up the foundation as well as his official partner – the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) – based in England.
When I asked Kevin for an interview, he was all smiles and eagerly accepted to come by the Nation’s office. A success driven individual and one who seems methodological in his endeavours, Kevin has already began planning for life after his playing career is over. Keen to know more about the 35-year-old, I sat down with Kevin to get the material for my very first interview piece.
Seychelles Nation: Kevin everyone knows you as Seychelles’ first professional footballer, but what can you tell us about you on a personal level?
Kevin Betsy: Well, I’m a very driven person and my career has obviously given me that grounding where you have to be dedicated to your profession and my parents taught me at a very young age not to surround myself around negative people. I try to focus very much on the goals that I want to achieve and also I’m a family man, having been brought up in a big family. I have three children, two daughters and the last one is a boy. I left Seychelles when I was two years old and have lived in England for the majority of my life.
Seychelles Nation: Your father was a very popular footballer here. Was he the one who pushed you into taking a career in football?
Kevin Betsy: Definitely yes. The first ball I kicked was at Beau Vallon when I was still a toddler. So yes, my upbringing was with him. He taught me some skills and educated me in my football development, but also he was a big player here so he was a big inspiration for me, being my role model and he always led me on the right path. Like if I was late for training, he would tell me not to go for training if I’m going to be late. He instilled discipline in me early on.
Seychelles Nation: You helped the Seychelles team win the first IOIG gold medal in 2011. How did you feel on that day?
Kevin Betsy: Fantastic jubilation really because I came to do a job for the country – to try and help the players and the coach who had done a fantastic job. A special thank you goes to Mr Suketu Patel for instigating my selection and persuading me to come for this tournament. I had to make a big sacrifice for my club in order to allow me to leave and try and get the gold medal and bring a smile on so many Seychellois faces. It was fantastic and I will never forget this moment.
Seychelles Nation: As a professional footballer, what can you say is the difference between amateur and professional football?
Kevin Betsy: Firstly, when I arrived here (in 2011), I didn’t think much of the boys as a team in all honesty. But my appreciation of them changed dramatically during the time I spent with them. We were like a professional club in terms of our mentality and our focus and this is why we achieved what we did. Forget about talented players and all that, if you haven’t got the focus and desire you won’t achieve anything. Players like Alpha Baldé was a great inspiration to us and there were some great young players like Alex Nibourette and Archille Henriette who did really well in the tournament as well as Don (Anacoura) the captain who was a great leader. We were a great team and I think these boys can play football and can achieve a lot and without a doubt become professional players if they ever wanted to. But tactically here in Seychelles the build-up is a lot slower, maybe because of the weather and a lot of Seychellois teams play a different defensive line, but football is football. They may need to be educated in terms of their discipline off the pitch, but they have some really good technical ability here and some naturally gifted footballers.
Seychelles Nation: Your current club, Woking, is not popular here, so what can you tell us about them?
Kevin Betsy: Woking is a good non-league team, a semi-professional club with fan base of about 3,000 which is quite a lot for a semi-professional club. We just got promoted to the Conference National Division which is the fifth division in English football and we are looking to get into the football league with promotion this season. Basically, it’s the first team I played for before I turned professional so I decided to go back to that team and try to help them and enjoy my last years of football because next year will probably be my last year of playing.
Seychelles Nation: So, what are your plans for the upcoming season?
Kevin Betsy: Just to try and enjoy my last season, and to help the team to at least reach the playoffs and maybe with an outside chance of getting promotion. Last year, I was player of the year and I want to have another good season for them as last year I scored 14 goals from midfield which is great, and I want to finish my career on a high. One of the main reasons I went back to Woking although I could have joined another professional team, is I did not want to leave the area and settle somewhere else. Woking gave me my chance before and I wanted to go back while I was still in good shape physically.
Seychelles Nation: You are most famous here because of your time at Fulham, so what can you tell us about your time there?
Kevin Betsy: I’m very fortunate to have played for such a great club. I achieved two promotions with them and then obviously playing in the Premier League. Now I have been lucky enough to have been invited to come and work for the club with the academy and bring my experience to the young players coming through.
Seychelles Nation: Are you thinking about taking up coaching after your playing career?
Kevin Betsy: Yes. About five years ago I decided to take some coaching qualifications, including my UEFA ‘B’ and ‘A’ licenses. But I have decided to start coaching the younger teams first and work my way up from there, because many players take up management jobs at big clubs because of their names and sometimes they end up failing. You have to do the apprenticeship and progress in order to succeed.
Seychelles Nation: In one of your online columns you compared your current manager – Garry Hill – to Harry Redknapp. So who would you say is the best manager you have worked with?
Kevin Betsy: Kevin Keegan obviously. I was named after him so he was already my best manager.  My best coach I would say is Jean Tigana who was fantastic, so these are probably up there.
Seychelles Nation: What can you tell us about the beginning of your career?
 Kevin Betsy: I was very young, 14 or 15 playing for the team in my district. I had England trials at under-16 and I didn’t get picked, which is one of the disappointments I’ve had in my career. So I had to change my mentality towards football with the support of my parents because I still believed I could play at good level. Afterwards I signed for the Woking youth team, then my manager at the time gave me a chance in the first team and I won the conference player of the year title in my first season. After that about four or five clubs made offers, but Fulham was the one that I decided to take.
Seychelles Nation: We all have the players we admire the most, who is your favourite player?
Kevin Betsy: Good question… let me think… There are a lot of players I admire, and my biggest role model is my father, but I’d say (Cristiano) Ronaldo is up there and is probably one of the best players, but I think Ryan Giggs is someone I would say is my favourite. Because Ryan Giggs is 39 years old and is still playing and is a fantastic role model for young players. I was lucky I did my ‘A’ license with Giggs so I got to spend two weeks in his company and he is a very nice guy, very humble and he is already going on the right path with his coaching.
Seychelles Nation: And your favourite team?
Kevin Betsy: My favourite team is West Ham because I was brought up really close to the ground. We’re an up and down team, we are not the best like Liverpool, Arsenal or Manchester United but, if you live in an area, you support that club. It’s easy to supporter Manchester United because they win all the time, but you have to be a bit more loyal.
Seychelles Nation: The new English Premier League season is about to start, what are your thoughts?
Kevin Betsy: I think Chelsea will win the English Premier League title this season. I think with Mourinho (Jose) coming back is going to make a huge difference. He has some good players and I think tactically he is probably among the best coaches.
Seychelles Nation: To conclude, do you have any words of advice for the local youths?
Kevin Betsy: Yeah… Just keep believing in your ability. Try as often as you can to stay focused on your goals in whatever profession you want to do. The only person who can stop you from achieving your dreams, is yourself. The Kevin Betsy Foundation is obviously going to be a good tool to try and help more youngsters achieve as much as they can in life and in the next few years we will be giving more opportunities to young people. The federation has already got a very good initiative with the Rising Stars programme and it is similar to what the foundation will be doing. We have a very good contact base in Europe and I have contact with every football club in England. There could  be opportunities for players to come to England and have trials and the foundation is going to help and support the good work that the federation is doing and work together to help the young players.

Up Close … with Vincent Milius, teacher, comedian, poet …-‘There’s always light at the end of a dark tunnel…’
30-July-2013
We fail to accept the consequences of the decisions and actions we make.  One person in
particular came to mind as I sat down pondering who the next person will be for our Up Close page.   Then it hit me; a person whose life choices sent him spiralling down a bottomless pit but who afterwards managed to soar out of it was just what I was looking for. That same person made some life-changing decisions that shaped the course of his future.
Meeting up with Vincent Milius, I knew I was in for a fascinating interview.  One that would surely leave a lasting impression on me and laughter across my face.  This is so because as a friend and past colleague, Vincent is not your typical everyday person; he has a gift for making people laugh their heads off. He is well reputed, especially by his students, for his comic appearances.  I decided to catch up with Vincent and see what he has been up to.
When I met him Vincent was on school holiday from work as a teacher at the International School but also preparing himself to teach at the School of Advance Level Studies (Sals) on a part-time basis.  When I asked him if he is getting paid for it, since he is also a full-time teacher in a private school, he replied: “I got it for free, so why should I be paid. It’s like giving back a little bit of what has been given to me.”
It goes to show the extent of Vincent’s gratitude.  Many times we forget or forgo the value of being grateful for the simplest things in life. 
Childhood
Born on July 10, 1980, Vincent is a resident of Intendance, specifically “Dan Ban Nwanr” of the Takamaka district. The name which initially meant “Bois Noir” -- a tree that can be used to make furniture -- has gradually phased out to become “Ban Nwanr” as we know it today. He grew up with his mother and eight other siblings.
He describes his mother as a strong woman who did her utmost best to take care of all of them after his father deserted them.  Alone with eight kids, his mother strived to ensure the well being of her children despite the hardship of life back then.
Vincent wittily remembers how her mother took him to the clinic one day after an outbreak of chickenpox.  He says that he loves his mum dearly because she did her best as a mother.
 
Vincent describes his childhood as pleasant and agreeable.  He was not in a rush to grow up but rather enjoyed and benefited immensely from his childhood years. He smiles as he recalls some of the little things from his childhood, like when he read the “Prière Universelle” for his Holy Communion.  He also remembers when each child was given a glass of milk in the evening after school which many kids enjoyed.
Education
Vincent attended Takamaka school from crèche till Secondary 2.  From S3 to S4 he went to Anse Royale followed by the National Youth Service (NYS) in 1997. He later proceeded to Foundation Studies at the Seychelles Polytechnic in Humanities and Science.  He also completed his Ordinary and Advance Level studies.  In 2008 Vincent graduated from the National Institute of Education with a Diploma in Social Sciences.
From the ashes is born a comedian
When asked how his love for drama started he said he was introduced to the art by his two teachers, Wilna Roseline and Maureen Lavigne.  At the time Vincent was in his first year of crèche.  He laughs as he himself cannot believe that he still remembers the title of the poem her two teachers taught him -- Lekel ki ti touy sren. 
From then on Vincent said it was as if he had been born for drama.  It’s a God given talent that comes naturally but he cannot forget his cousins Dr Justin Valentin and Dr Bernard Valentin who have also inspired him.  One can say that drama and poetry runs in their blood.  When asked if he has stage fright before a performance he responded by saying:
“I am allergic to stage fright, and I do not rehearse anything, it just flows spontaneously.”  Just to show the extent of his talent, Vincent won both the 1st prize and the star prize in last December’s stand-up comedy.
The first drama piece he wrote was entitled Ler lanmour i lalang.  He is writing a second piece entitled Lalert, laprid ek lapitennri. I laughed at the title as I can imagine, for sure, it will send the audience in stitches.
However before Vincent got to the height of his fame as a teacher and comedian, as well as poet, he had his share of difficulties in life.  As an ex-convict, for a mistake that he is not proud of, Vincent got the chance to sit for his exams while in prison.  He was determined to give himself another chance to shine.  “I consider myself as an imperfect individual, I have committed many errors, but I have learned a great deal from my many mistakes.  I consider myself strong as I was able to bounce back on my two feet, while never giving up,” added Vincent.
Vincent strongly believes that rehabilitation for offenders can only be accomplished if one accepts to be rehabilitated. “The government can offer the best rehabilitation scheme that can exist but if one is not willing to change and accept being helped then the programme will fail.  Rehabilitation is a lifelong process; one must be willing to proceed with it to the end.”
He admits to it being a difficult time in his life due to his action, but he accepts his mistakes and this has allowed him to move forward and grow up academically and socially. It has allowed him to be the funny guy we all know because he made a choice to learn from the faux pas he took.
“My message to everyone is that difficulties will exist. Jesus himself said that life will not be easy, however we should all remember that at the end of the dark tunnel, there is light.”
The Teacher
Schools that have known Vincent as a teacher will agree that there is never a dull moment, especially if something special is being organised like Children’s Day.  He will take the stage and send the crowd laughing till their ribcage hurts.  His stand-up comedies are full of humour but never lack a didactic twist to send us thinking about how we are living our life on this earth.
Vincent says once he wanted to become a lawyer but his true calling to become a teacher had always been there.  “I may not be a legal lawyer but I am still defending the kids as a teacher,” says Vincent. He does not believe that a person is born for himself but rather for society. 
“A teacher is a vocation,” adds Vincent, “and I chose this field because I love working with kids.” 
Many times he had tried to leave to venture into something new but found himself coming back to the starting point.  Among the schools he has taught at includes Plaisance, Anse Boileau, Anse Royale, English River secondary schools and presently the International School.  He worked at the Ministry of Education for a while as well.  Teaching has helped him to grow as a person, as he does not only teach but is willing to learn from the kids.
Rather than being pessimistic about the challenging job he has as a teacher, Vincent believes that he has more fulfilling moments rather than low ones in his career. 
“One must bear in mind that once engaged as a teacher there will be tough times, as kids will always be kids. Dealing with teenagers is not an easy task; as teachers we at times have to lower ourselves to their level in order to understand them.
“My greatest satisfaction is seeing the students that are categorised as low academically manage to achieve the smallest of things, and come back and say sir thank you for what you did for me.”
At that moment during our interview, Vincent’s phone beeped; it was a text message from a student he was tutoring.  She was thanking him for his help.  Now I can understand what he meant. These small acts of gratitude are heartwarming.
Plans for the future
Among his many achievements Vincent represented the Ministry of Education in the History Fair.  He was the representative member for the Takamaka district in the Youth National Assembly and also became the vice-chairman of NRA (Neighbourhood Recreational Activities). To crown it all he was voted Best Youth in Seychelles in 2007.  “Today I am making my mother proud of me,” he said.
One would thing that he feels fulfilled, but not Vincent. He wants to go to the next level and that is to get his Doctorate Degree in History, and again it is his cousin Dr Justin Valentin who is his source of inspiration. 
On August 5, 2013 Vincent will be accompanying Joseph Sinon to the “Festival Rire” in Mauritius as well as on the “Big 5” regional music tour.  Indeed Vincent has many more of himself that he wants to give, as he puts it: “I want to share my knowledge with the youths of Seychelles until I can no more.” 
For sure life’s limitations should not prevent one from daring to spread one’s wing and fly.
To end our interview Vincent had this to say:
« Mon anvi vin en pti zetwal
Pa pour mwan
Pour Sesel
Avan mon ferm mon lizye pour la dernyen fwa
Anter mwan dan later Takamaka. »

Insurance firm ensures staff training
30-July-2013

Effective insurance cover is anyway not possible without competent staff and this is why the company has developed a training policy with different training programmes.
In line with this policy, Sacos recently organised a four month Level 1 Insurance Course for eighteen newly appointed staff members as well as five from Fidelity, Reliance, Belairy and DAART’S insurance brokers.
The course participants received their certificates in a short ceremony at the Sacos Tower last Friday afternoon in the presence of the Sacos Group chief executive officer Antonio Lucas, the general manager for operations Jane Joubert and the course facilitators.
Sales executive Charmayne Decommarmond was thankful to Sacos for the training which she said had extended her knowledge of general insurance:
“The course offers an interesting opportunity to better understand what insurance is. It has taught us that insurance, which is a very technical field, goes further than what we do in the office every day. We have been equipped with deeper knowledge on how to better serve our clients and provide them with quality insurance solutions.”
She said it is a good idea for the group to be provided with on-the-job training as it enables them to study and work at the same time. She also had praise for the continuous assessment system which enables them to space their revisions and thus go on with their other activities.
Charmayne de Commarmond, sales executive of the State Assurance Corporation of Seychelles (Sacos), came out first among the delegates and was the only one who scored a distinction in the level one insurance course and Mrs Belairy scored the highest mark among the brokers. Mrs Belairy described the training as “important, high level, comprehensive, well delivered and above expectations”.
 
She said that the training will surely bring a plus to her company as she has broadened her awareness of general insurance, reinsurance, life assurance and their respective products, as well as customer service. As a broker, she feels that she is now better acquainted with Sacos and its subsidiaries and this will improve her working relationship with the company.
Both Sacos and broking company staff have expressed the wish that the insurance company continues to organise such courses.
They are now looking forward to the Insurance Level 2 Course which will be held in September this year. The programme extends to Level 3 which is more comprehensive and designed for higher level staff.

Indian experts give details on benefits of new micro-organism
30-July-2013
Delegates and guests at the presentation yesterday
This was during a meeting held yesterday at the Seychelles Fishing Authority’s conference room.
Attending the presentation were Minister for Natural Resources Peter Sinon and the ministry’s principal secretary Michael Nalletamby.
The presentation was given by director general of the Amity institute of microbial technology (AIMT) and Amity University in Uttar Pradesh, Professor Ajit Varma.
His presentation was entitled small ideas make big impact − Piriformospora Indica − underground root engineering.
Piriformospora indica is a newly described cultivable endophyte that colonises roots.
An endophyte is often a bacterium or fungus which lives within a plant for at least part of its life without causing apparent disease.
This fungus provides a model organism for the study of beneficial plant-microbe interactions and a new tool for improving plant production systems.
During his presentation, Prof. Varma briefed those present on the fungus and its benefits to plants, its interaction with plants such as tobacco and fruit trees such as mango and litchee.
He also showed them examples of experiments done to prove the effectiveness of this micro-organism.
In the 1990’s, the Indian expert discovered the fungus - Piriformospora indica - that grows in the Thar Desert in north-western India and significantly boosts the growth of various crop plants and medicinal herbs.
Desert shrubs provide the natural habitat of the fungus. It can be readily cultivated, and the growth of many different plants is promoted when inoculated with the fungus.
The next step which the agricultural agency will take is to carry out a pilot project using this new technology to see if it can be used in the country.

Street lights powered by the sun
30-July-2013
The Seychelles Land Transport Agency (SLTA) started the solar photovoltaic street light project in May and said it is well underway with lights shining bright at night at the Stad Popiler car park, areas of Roche Caïman, Pointe Larue and La Retraite.
A donation from the People’s Republic of China, the 200 state-of-the-art street lights will be installed on Mahé, Praslin and La Digue. 
“They look just like normal street lights,” said SLTA chief executive Parinda Herath. “Except that at the top you will see an installed photovoltaic unit, or solar panel, which collects energy from the sun and powers up the light in a very clean and efficient manner,” he added.
So far, 25 of these special street lights have been installed on Mahé where every district will be covered. Another 40 will be installed on La Digue and Praslin.
Mr Herath has thanked the general public for their interest in this project and said that “the agency is pleased to take part in an approach that adds safety and security to Seychellois communities by using clean energy from the sun which shines on our beautiful islands to brighten our nights”.
Solar street lights are raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure. The photovoltaic panels charge a rechargeable battery, which powers a fluorescent or LED lamp during the night.
Most solar panels turn on and turn off automatically by sensing outdoor light using a light source. Solar street lights are designed to work throughout the night. Many can stay lit for more than one night if the sun is not available for a couple of days.

Coco de mer grows in Chicago
30-July-2013

The coco de mer seed has started to sprout in a Chicago greenhouse

The article entitled ‘Rare palm tree sprouting at Chicago greenhouse’ says that the “Chicago greenhouse is celebrating its success in sprouting a rare palm tree that could someday reach the height of a six-storey building”.
It adds that the Garfield Park Conservatory announced last Friday its staff has sprouted a double coconut palm from a difficult-to-obtain seed. The palm is native to two places in the world, both of which are in the Seychelles islands.
Last year, a 45-year-old double coconut palm died at the conservatory. It took six months to obtain the 20-pound seed. The conservatory staff consulted with experts and planted it using a heating coil to keep the soil at 90 degrees. The shoot now is about 6 inches tall and is growing one centimetre a day.
It's planted under the tallest part of the 65-foot roof, so it has room to grow.

Large youth delegation to attend Madagascar Baha’i conference
30-July-2013

Although the conference is being organised by the Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the Baha’i faith, non Baha’is have also been invited to attend and a number of them form part of the Seychelles’ delegation.
Organisers have said that the aim is not to convert people to the Baha’I faith, but to help build a better world where we will all live more happily.
The conference is part of 114 other youth conferences of the same nature to be held around the world between July and October this year and its central theme will be ‘Youth participation in the betterment of society’.
During their stay in Madagascar, the 43 young Seychellois will have the opportunity to interact with their counterparts from Madagascar, Mauritius and Réunion on such topics as the characteristics inherent to the period of youth, the historical contribution of young people to the transformation of society, the responsibilities of the present generation of youth, the society building power of the Baha’i teachings, the importance of faith and tenacity to a life of service and the great responsibility facing young people to contribute to the betterment of society.
Upon their return to Seychelles, the conference delegates will translate the knowledge gained into action by teaching other youths and also engaging with elder people in voluntary services in their respective neighbourhoods and districts as well as at national level.
Addressing the youths in a preparatory meeting at the Bel Air Baha’i Centre on Saturday afternoon, one of the accompanying adults, Felix Charles, said that as the young generation, they are better placed to bring a positive change to the world.
“The youth is better placed to move the world. The conference you are going to attend will bring you together with other youths of the Indian Ocean for a better world. Through your good actions you can start moving Seychelles by working with elderly people to educate the rest of society and make Seychelles a better place, because you, the 15 to 30 year olds, represent the majority of our population. The destiny of humanity is in your hands and you now have the opportunity to contribute to change the human race. Civilization will change through your efforts,” was the message he delivered to them.
One of the missions assigned to the participating delegation is to contribute to change the persistent conditions giving rise to social ills and diseases, of which Seychelles is already a victim. On this note, the youth have committed themselves to show respect for each other, abstain from cigarette, drug and alcohol consumption as well as premarital sex.
The delegation, which is being led by young Regina Prosper, is due back on August 7.
Seychelles Nation expects to publish a detailed account of the conference and of the participation of our youths upon their return.

The elections were held on Saturday at the Red Cross headquarters at Providence during the branch’s general assembly.

Letter to the Editor-Food for thought?
29-July-2013
I understand that the building close to the State House gate formerly occupied by the Court of Appeal will house the History Museum and the former Supreme Court the offices of the Mayor of Victoria.
I write to offer a humble suggestion. I do so as a person with a keen interest in our history and a regular user of the two buildings until they were recently decommissioned as courts. Victoria is a pretty capital, fondly enjoyed by Seychellois and visitors alike.
Seychelles is an attractive destination for visitors and Victoria a must-see attraction in its own right. Tourists love museums, galleries and the like. With no disrespect meant to the office of the capital’s mayor, I have a feeling that a central location for a museum is more important to the capital than a Mairie. After all, both National Assembly and Law Courts no longer occupy central locations.
Can I offer a suggestion? I should like to suggest that the proposed use of the two buildings be swapped. Let the Mayor’s office be housed in the smaller building at State House Avenue and the History Museum in the ex-Supreme Court. The History Museum is currently undergoing a revamp which has seen the French period set out in detail and the British and Seychellois periods being prepared in a similar format. To fully appreciate these interesting exhibits space is required. I fear that the small ex-Court of Appeal building will cramp the museum and its exhibits. That would be a pity.
A history museum in the old Law Courts would be an attractive proposition. The building will better contain the exhibits and the gardens around could accommodate seating for visitors to relax and Victoria workers perhaps to enjoy their lunch in a pleasant setting. Just looking at the two buildings, the old Supreme Court building cries out ‘Museum!’ and the old Court of Appeal, ‘Mairie!’
I hope that this small suggestion does not come too late and does not offend too many people.

Cuban community commemorates revolution
29-July-2013

For the occasion, Cuban nationals gathered for a reception at the former Maritime Training Centre at Mont Fleuri, in the presence of members of the Seychelles-Cuba Friendship Association (Secufa), members of the National Assembly media committee and other friends.
Addressing the gathering, MNA Dereck Samson said that July 26 was an important date for the Cuban people as it marks the day they took the decisive step to liberate their country from neo-colonialism and poverty.
He said the event was also an opportunity to celebrate the friendship between Seychelles and Cuba and looked forward to seeing the good cooperation strengthened in the future.
Dr Liban Borroto, a Cuban national currently working in Seychelles, said that July 26, 1953 is a historical date in the Cuban history and in the long and heroic fight for the freedom of their homeland because it was from the events of that date that the Cubans learned the values of patriotism, freedom, dignity, faith in the people as well as the rejection of despotism.
As an example to measure the success of his country’s revolution, he mentioned the large number of Cuban professionals – teachers, sports people, health workers – working around the world and the important contribution they make to mankind.
“Today we have more than 53,000 health collaborators of whom more than 15,000 are medical doctors in 70 different countries. They have carried out 2 million childbirths and 7 million surgeries which have saved a great number of lives. This is one of the greatest achievements of our revolution which we will continue to pursue with conviction, loyalty, altruism, solidarity and patriotism in order to maintain freedom and justice,” said Dr Borroto.
The Cuban community in Seychelles currently comprises around 50 members, mainly volunteer professionals.
On July 26, 1953 a group of young men and two women led by Fidel Castro attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba, the second most important city in the country, while at the same time, another group attacked the Carlos Manuel de Céspedes Barracks in the city of Bayamo.
Although the events of July 26, 1953 were the expression of a military defeat, it has been emphasised that it paved the way for the insurrection against Batista, “the small engine that ignited the big engine of the Revolution”.

Seychelles to boost economic ties in Shanghai through new consulate general
29-July-2013

During a meeting held last week with the leaders of the Shanghai municipal government, Seychelles’ Foreign Affairs minister Jean Paul Adam extended his appreciation to the municipal government for its collaboration with the Seychelles authorities in establishing a presence in Shanghai to better support the economic and people to people exchanges between the two countries.
The proposed consulate general will cover the shanghai municipality, Jiangsu Province and Zhejiang Province.
During his visit to Shanghai, Minister Adam also had the opportunity to visit the Huawei Technologies Cooperation, which is a leading ICT leading solutions provider.
Huawei, a private company established in 1987, is now among the first five ICT providers in China and has 16 regional headquarters with operations in over 140 countries.
During the visit, Minister Adam stated that despite the differences in size between the two countries, there were many mutually beneficial economic opportunities to be taken up.
"Very large countries such as China, and very small countries such as Seychelles need to invest in technology and in efficiency to ensure competitiveness. The small market in Seychelles can allow quick adoption of new technologies and we are an ideal testing station."
Minister Adam added that Shanghai was a key location for the growth and promotion of tourism, and thus the importance of establishing its first consulate general of this kind in Shanghai.

Seychelles and South Sudan establish diplomatic relations
29-July-2013

Seychelles officially recognised South Sudan as a sovereign and independent state soon after South Sudan declared its independence on July 9, 2011.
It was through the formal exchange of notes by Ambassador Barry Faure, the secretary of state in the Seychelles Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ambassador Charles Manyang D’Awol, the undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Republic of South Sudan, that formal diplomatic relations between the two countries have been established.
Ambassador Faure had been dispatched by President James Michel to convey a special message of friendship and cooperation of the Seychellois people to the people of South Sudan on the occasion of the second anniversary of the independence of the Republic of South Sudan.
Mr Faure was received by Salva Kiir Mayardit, the President of the Republic of South Sudan, and other high-level government officials.
During the meeting with President Mayardit, discussions focused on the scope of cooperation and exchanges between the two countries in the political, socio-economic, and cultural fields.
President Mayardit warmly welcomed this first visit of a government official from Seychelles to South Sudan and spoke of the common values that the two countries share and which must be defended internationally.
He underscored the need for greater cooperation and solidarity between African countries to further unlock Africa’s enormous socio-economic potential.
President Mayardit also expressed his strong support for President Michel’s principled foreign policy objectives.
Ambassador Faure conveyed President Michel’s belief in the strength of south-south cooperation and of the strong willingness of Seychelles to share its experience in nation building with the government of South Sudan as it strives to meet the aspirations of its people.
In expressing the appreciation of the government of Seychelles towards the government of South Sudan for having facilitated this visit, Ambassador Faure stated:
“South Sudan, as the world’s newest country, has great potential to realise the dreams and aspirations of its people. Two years ago, Seychelles welcomed the formal creation of South Sudan as an independent state. Today, we celebrate the positive relationship between the two countries and the many links we share, including our commitment to our shared aspirations for peace and prosperity across the African continent.”
The ambassador added: “The creation of South Sudan two years ago gave hope to its people for a better, brighter future. I am confident that the same resolve and determination that made the independence of South Sudan a reality will continue to steer the way forward so that the people of South Sudan can enjoy the full benefits of peace, justice and development. Seychelles is committed in supporting South Sudan’s development as a democratic nation.”
Michelle Murray, the director general for International Relations in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied Ambassador Faure on this official visit.

Seychelles and Switzerland strikes new air service accord
29-July-2013
The new arrangement, which was concluded last week, supersedes the air services framework which existed since 1995, providing enhanced flexibilities to attract airlines to tap into the air access potential that exist between Seychelles and Switzerland, be it via direct or indirect services or cooperative arrangements between the airlines.
“This new bilateral arrangement in civil aviation goes some way in enhancing the good relations that is shared between Seychelles and Switzerland, which dates as far back as 1976,” said Gilbert Faure, chief executive of the Seychelles Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA).
“The expected improvement in air access will open more opportunities for the people of our two countries, to enhance current cooperation initiatives and seek to develop commercial potentials in the field of tourism as well as trade and investment,” he added.
Joel Morgan, the Minister for Home Affairs and Transport, applauded this new development, which he sees as yet another breakthrough in the evolution of Seychelles’ air transport industry.
“Similar to other European countries, for the Swiss people, Seychelles is a dream destination. The people of Switzerland have a keen affinity to the environment, eager to explore the exotic and Seychelles has the potential to serve this market better,” said Minister Morgan.
“To date, we are experiencing 11% growth in Swiss visitor traffic to our shores but the opportunities remain endless. Bordered on all corners by Germany, France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein, Switzerland is strategically positioned to serve as yet another European hub to Seychelles,” Minister Morgan added.
The agreement was initialed by Mr Faure, on behalf of the government of Seychelles, and Laurence Fontana Jungo, the chief negotiator of air services agreements of the Federal Office of Civil Aviation, on behalf of the government of Switzerland.
Mr Faure was also accompanied by Alan Renaud, Air Seychelles’ general manager of corporate affairs.
The air service agreement between Seychelles and Switzerland is a reflection of Seychelles’ revitalised air transport policy, as it concludes the first among a series of new air services framework initiated with several countries in Europe.

Volleyball: FIVB World Championships qualifiers – Africa zone 7, games two-Easy rides for Seychelles against Mauritius
29-July-2013
Social Affairs, Community Development and Sports Minister Vincent Meriton, community development and sports principal secretary Denis Rose, National Sports Council chief executive Giovanna Rousseau, Confederation of African Volleyball (CABV) technical official, Mauritian Kaysee Teeroovengadum and Seychelles Volleyball Federation (SVF) chairman Jude Florentine were also present to witness the Seychelles teams post their second wins in as many matches in the Africa sub-zonal (zone seven) 2014 FIVB World Championships qualifiers.
It was fitting that Seychellois Ronald Wong became the first person to be awarded the CAVB zone seven trophy for his devotion and contribution towards the organisation. Mr Teeroovengadum handed over the glass trophy to Mr Wong, who is a member of the SVF.
From the previous day’s (Friday’s) game one results – 3-1 (22-25, 25-20, 25-14, 25-18) for the women’s team and 3-0 (25-23, 25-13, 25-19) for the men’s – it was not a secret that Seychelles would run over Mauritius, but head coaches Nichol Lesperance (women’s side) and James Camille (men) did not take any chances as they paraded their strong teams in the opening sets.

Despite lapses of concentration, especially after having taken big leads thus letting their opponents close and even draw level on points, Seychelles won the matches in three sets.
Although France-based captain and setter Nathalie Agnes took a seat on the substitutes’ bench in the third set as young and diminutive Melina Crispin took over the setting duties, coach Lesperance’s team needed 69 minutes to win 3-0 (25-19, 25-23, 25-21).
As for the men’s side captained by Ian Furneau, they once again triumphed 3-0 (25-20, 25-18, 25-19) after 125 minutes of play against the Mauritians captained by Gilbert Alfred who had a spell in Qatar but now plays for Trou Aux Biches in their local league.
Female volleyballer of the year Berlira Jacqueline told Sports Nation she was happy with the team’s play on Saturday.
“We improved our game, made less mistakes than in our first match on Friday and our reception was much better,” said Jacqueline who is one of five Friends players on the team.
Men’s assistant coach François Ally said his team’s play went according to plan.
“We studied Mauritius’ play and then adjusted our blocks. Our attack was our strong point as the seasoned players made their experience count,” said Ally, himself a former Seychelles international and member of the team who won Seychelles its first Indian Ocean Island Games gold medal in 1993 at the same Palais des Sports.
The third matches were to be played yesterday although both Seychelles and Mauritius had already qualified for the second stage of the Africa zone seven qualifiers for the 2014 FIVB World Championships after the other countries declined to take part in the sub-zonal qualifiers.
The second stage of the qualifiers will be held in Mauritius, but the dates and playing format are yet to be revealed by the CAVB.
The winners of the second stage of the zone seven qualifiers will join 11 other teams from Africa – one from zone 1 and two from zones 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 – where they will be drawn into two pools of six. The two pool winners will represent Africa at the women’s World Championships which will be contested by 24 teams.

The Seychelles men’s team also have to beat Mauritius in stage two of the zone seven qualifiers to progress to the third round where they will join the other 11 African teams – one from zone 1 and two each from zones 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Following a draw, the 12 teams will play in three groups of four and the three group winners will make it to world championships in Poland in 2014.
Hosts Italy have already qualified for the women’s world championships, while defending champions Russia, who will be looking for a third consecutive triumph, will also take part in the qualifiers.
The distribution by confederation for the 2014 FIVB women's world championships is as follows: Asia (four places), Africa (two places), Europe (nine places + Italy qualified automatically as host nation for a total of 10 places), South America (two places) and North, Central America and Caribbean (six places).
The distribution by confederation for the 2014 FIVB men's world championships is as follows: Asia (four places), Africa (three places), Europe (eight places + Poland qualified automatically as host nation for a total of nine places), South America (three places) and North, Central America and Caribbean (five places). Hosts Poland have already qualified.

Football: Airtel Cup-The Lions down Côte d’Or, St Louis Suns win, St Michel draw
29-July-2013
On Friday St Michel could only manage a 1-1 draw against La Digue-based Anse Reunion.
The Lions - Côte d’Or
Defending Airtel Cup holders Côte d’Or were in buoyant mood as they faced The Lions who were without coach Gavin Jeanne who is on an overseas mission with the under-17 national team in Mauritius.
 
Therefore, former Seychelles Football Federation (SFF) chairman Joel Decommarmond was the acting coach as he got his team to frustrate Côte d’Or who were the better side as they were still buzzing after their win over St Michel the previous weekend.
In the 16th minute, Collin Esther went mighty close after some good approach play by the players of coach Ahmed Abdou but his shot came off the post.
In the 25th minute, footballer of the year, Malagasy Jean Tigana, fired a free-kick at goalkeeper Jerome Dingwall who he pushed the ball out as far as Dine Suzette whose shot produced a good save out of The Lions’ goalkeeper.
Two minutes later, Suzette broke down on the right to centre to Malagasy Patrick Rasaminana but he failed to connect from a good scoring position.
In the 35th minute, The Lions, who were under a lot of pressure, had a decent chance as Denis Auguste latched onto a through-ball but goalkeeper Kitson Cecile was quick off his line to clear the danger.
Côte d’Or nearly broke the deadlock in the 38th minute from Tigana’s corner which was punched out to Bernard St Ange whose fierce drive grazed the outside of the post.
Côte d’Or continued to dominate proceedings in the second half and in the 52nd minute Suzette’s close range header was deflected into Collin Esther’s path but he shot the loose ball wide.
The Lions had another great chance on the hour mark as new recruit Leeroy Mathiot broke clear but he shot in the side-netting with the goal at this mercy.
In the 82nd minute, Malagasy Patrick played a neat one-two with Suzette to curve open The Lions’ defence but goalkeeper Dingwall rushed out to charge down his shot.
As the minutes ticked away, Côte d’Or pushed men forward and in the 89th minute goalkeeper Dingwall again denied his former teammate Suzette.
The Lions though hit Côte d’Or with a killer blow in the dying seconds of this match as captain Randolph Lablache collected a long ball and he looked suspiciously offside but assistant referee Darnsley Télémaque did not raise his flag. Captain Lablache bore on goal and was brought down by goalkeeper Cecile.
Referee Alistair Barra had no hesitation but to show the Côte d’Or goalkeeper a straight red card as well as awarding a penalty to The Lions.
As Côte d’Or had already made three substitutions, they had to put Francis Louise in goal to face the penalty from Rachim Padayachy who blasted the ball past him for a 1-0 lead.
Côte d’Or did not have time to react as the final whistle blew after they kicked off as The Lions celebrated wildly while the Praslin side were furious with the officials.
LightStars - St Louis Suns
St Louis Suns registered an important win on Praslin against 10-man LightStars after Bertrand Lablache was sent off in the 58th minute by referee Kierens Yocette as he thought he should have been awarded a penalty.
St Louis Suns had taken the lead through a header by Steve Henriette in the ninth minute.
LightStars though leveled matters in the 32nd minute through a penalty taken by Andrew Jean.
St Louis Suns retook the lead on the stroke of half-time and it was an own goal accredited to Mervin Jeannevol for a 2-1 victory.
St Michel - Anse Reunion
St Michel and Anse Reunion shared the spoils in a 1-1 draw on Friday at Stad Linite.
Anse Reunion started brightly and in the 13th minute Yelvanny Rose tested reserve goalkeeper Madrid Adrienne with a superb volley but he was equal to the task.
Two minutes later, Nickerro Marie broke through to shoot at goalkeeper Adrienne who parried the ball but it trickled over the goal-line for a 1-0 lead.
St Michel responded as Alex Nibourette went on a mazy run from his own half before laying the ball off to Nigel Hoareau but he shot weakly at goalkeeper Jean-Paul Ah-Kong.
Midway in this half, Anse Reunion nearly stretched their lead as Roderick Rose rifled at goalkeeper Adrienne who turned the ball into corner.
On the half hour mark, former Anse Reunion midfielder, Malagasy Hassan Aly, centred and goalkeeper Ah-Kong missed the ball but Hoareau did not make the most of the opportunity.
St Michel put Anse Reunion under a lot of pressure and they reaped the reward in the 44th minute from Patrick Bonne’s cross which was met by captain Don Anacoura’s header which was parried by goalkeeper Ah-Kong. But Nibourette was on hand to bury the loose ball to make it 1-1 at half-time.
St Michel were still the dominant side in the second period and in the 59th minute captain Anacoura picked out Gervais Waye-Hive with his cross but he failed to convert.
Two minutes later, Aly let fly a 35-metre free-kick which goalkeeper Ah-Kong just managed to tip over.
In the 61st minute Nibourette beat Anse Reunion’s offside trap to loft a pass to Hoareau who was clean through but he somehow shot in the side-netting.
Two minutes later at the other end, Roderick Rose sent in an inch-perfect cross to Malagasy Gilles Rapiera but with the goal begging, he headed over.
St Michel were denied a clear penalty in the 74th minute as Malagasy Eddy handled substitute Darwin Rosette’s cross but referee Nelson Emile allowed play to go on.
Anse Reunion though were reduced to 10 men in the 88th minute as Rapiera was shown his second yellow card of the match for some niggling fouls and he had to leave the field.
However, the La Digue side held on for a share of the points.
St Michel manager Andrew Jean-Louis told Sports Nation his team lacked a lethal striker with both Jean Del’Or Tsaralaza and Leeroy Corallie out injured as they gave some of their youngsters some playing time.

Badminton: Knockout competition-Camille, Cupidon win singles title
29-July-2013
Cupidon had defeated his fiercest rival Steve Malcouzane 2-0 (21-18, 21-17) in the semifinal and he met up-and-coming Kervin Ghislain in the final.
Ghislain had beaten Richie Course in the other semifinal and gave the more experienced Cupidon a tough match especially in the first set which ended 23-21.
Cupidon wrapped up the second set 21-16 to win his first title.
Cupidon later on teamed up with Malcouzane to claim the men’s doubles title getting the better of Kervin Ghislain and Richie Course in straight sets – 21-14 and 21-14.

However Cupidon did not make it to the mixed doubles final as he joined forces with Juliette Ah-Wan and they lost to Malcouzane and Cynthia Course in the semifinal.
As for Alisen Camille, she won three titles as she edged out Juliette Ah-Wan in the singles final in three tight sets – 21-17, 19-21 and 21-11 – as Ah-Wan ran out of steam.
Camille told Sports Nation that she is happy she managed to win over her cousin Ah-Wan.
“It was not an easy match but tactically I played well and I am very happy to have won the singles as well as the other two titles,” Camille said.
As for Ah-Wan, she said she made too many mistakes, especially in the third set which proved costly.

Camille then combined with cousin Ah-Wan to lift the women’s doubles title as they brushed aside the challenge of Chlorie Cadeau and Patricia Course in the final on a 2-0 (21-2, 21-5) score.
Camille then contested the mixed doubles finals alongside Kervin Ghislain and they had to fend off a strong challenge from Cynthia Course and Steve Malcouzane in three fiercely disputed sets two win 2-1 (22-20, 17-21, 21-16) and claim her third title of the afternoon.
The winners received cash prizes sponsored by the Seychelles Badminton Association.

Value Added Tax-Zero-rated supplies explained
29-July-2013
Zero-rated supplies must not be confused with exempt supplies that are out of the Vat scope, they are taxable but in practice given that they are taxed at 0% no Vat is actually charged.
Which supplies are zero rated under the Vat Act?
All exports are zero rated because Vat is a local-based consumption tax and is therefore not charged on consumption made abroad. However it is important to note that companies registered under the SITZ regulations are not considered as making zero-rated supplies because of their special characteristics where they are deemed to be operating outside the Seychelles jurisdiction hence they are outside the scope of the Vat system.
In addition to exports, there are also some designated supplies which are zero rated under the Vat Act. Some examples include:
- goods sold in a duty free shop;
- goods imported to be exported;
- supply of international transport of goods and/or passengers;
- ancillary services directly connected with international transportation of goods;
- supply of maritime’s services including maintenance and repairs of vessels;
- Supply of management and maintenance of facilities at aerodromes.
For the complete list see Schedule II of the Value Added Tax Act 2010.
It is important to note that if a supply is both a zero-rated and an exempt supply, the supply will be treated as a zero-rated supply.
What are the differences between zero-rated and exempt supplies?
Zero-rated supplies are taxable, even though no Vat is actually collected (Vat is charged at 0%) on transactions involving such supplies. However input tax incurred in the making of zero-rated supplies is fully deductible (unless otherwise provided in the Vat Act 2010), meaning that a business making zero-rated supplies can claim for a Vat credit or refund under Vat.
Exempt supplies on the other hand are outside the scope of the Vat system. No Vat can be charged on supplies which are exempted under the Vat Act 2010. At the same time exempt supplies do not create any deduction right of the input tax correlated to transactions involving such exempt supplies. They cannot charge Vat and they cannot claim input tax credits or refund of Vat.
For example, educational institutions (their supplies are exempt under the Vat Act 2010) will not be able to deduct any Vat they incur, say for example on their monthly telephone bills because their supplies are exempted from Vat.

You can contact Seychelles Revenue Commission on 4293745 or email us at vat@src.gov.sc.    The Value Added Tax Act, 2010 and the Vat manual is available on the Seychelles Revenue Commission website: www.src.gov.sc

Rosebelle trail project gets big boost
29-July-2013

The event forms part of the bank’s corporate responsibility in engaging with key stakeholders in the country to support activities that will benefit and impact positively on the local community.
Rosebelle trail is located in the Plaisance district in the La Misère area, with a breathtaking
and bird’s eye view of the Fair View Estate community, Eden Island and the inner islands.
The trail’s starting point is about 75 metres off the already established Salazie trail. On one side on top of the cliff one can also enjoy the view of Grand Anse and the Bay of Anse Boileau.
The ongoing Rosebelle trail is an environmental project expected to be completed by end of the year.  The project itself is being monitored through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the GEF Small Grants Programme. Other partners such as the Ministry of Environment also provide support to the project in terms of facilitation and guidance.
The main aim of the weekend activity with the Barclays team was to assist the Plaisance Community Outreach Committee with the ongoing building works on the trail. The whole group jointly shared the work load of laying wooden steps along the pathway, clearing of invasive plants along the trail and also planting of 50 endemic palm trees. The latter activity forms part of the “Campaign of 20,000 new trees project” launched by President James Michel in 2012 which aims to motivate people to plant trees and improve the quality of their environment.
The event also provided the Barclays team with an opportunity to understand the Rosebelle Trail project and how it will benefit the local community upon completion. 
Going forward, both the Barclays team and the Plaisance Community Outreach Committee have agreed to look at possibilities where the bank may come in the future to assist with the works required to complete the trail.
 
The accompanying photos show the Barclays team and members of the Plaisance committee during their July 20 activity along the Rosebelle trail and the panoramic view that one can enjoy when using the trail.

SACOS Motor Insurance-Knowing you are well protected makes all the difference
29-July-2013
Most people do not realise that they are not covered properly until something happens and once someone realises they were not covered properly - it is too late.
Options
As a general rule, when you take out a car insurance policy, you will be offered a choice of two main levels of cover:
SACOS Comprehensive car insurance
This gives the widest cover including:
• Repair or replacement of your car if it is damaged or stolen
• Injury to other people including passengers in the car
• Damage to other people's cars and property
• Windscreen repair or replacement
• Your car stereo and loss or damage to personal effects
SACOS Third Party cover (TP)
Third party: the minimum type of motor insurance you can take out is “third party”. This covers liability for:
• Injuries to other people, including passengers
• Damage to other people’s property
• Accidents caused by passengers in the car
Although SACOS provides the basic cover, the company offers additional variants on the policies, such as courtesy cars in the event of theft or accident, or protected no-claims bonuses. These and other options such as windscreen cover and loss of use may be added at additional costs.
SACOS offers special rates
If you are a lady driver, a SACOS shareholder or a tenant of SACOS, we have special motor insurance rates just for you.  SACOS also offers competitive introductory rates for new motor vehicles.

Volleyball: FIVB World Championships qualifiers – Africa zone 7-Seychelles teams win opening matches
27-July-2013
Captained by France-based setter Natalie Agnes, the Seychelles women’s team dropped the first set before recovering to beat Mauritius 3-1 (22-25, 25-20, 25-14, 25-18).

The men’s side, skippered by Ian Furneau, whitewashed their Mauritian opponents 3-0 (25-23, 25-13, 25-19).

Both Seychelles and Mauritius have already qualified for the second stage of the Africa World Championships qualifiers after the other countries declined to take part in the sub-zonal qualifiers.

According to the rule, the two countries’ women’s and men’s teams had to play at least one match. But the Seychelles Volleyball Federation (SVF) decided to have three matches instead to give local volleyball fans the opportunity to see our teams in action.
The second set of matches is today at 4pm and 6pm at the Palais des Sports. The third matches are slated for tomorrow at the same times and venue.

They can now make and receive calls, send and receive SMS and access their mails while on international flights.
Airtel Seychelles’ country manager Vikram Sinha said this service will definitely be a big plus for business travellers who are connected to Airtel.
“It will give them the opportunity to productively use the time they spend on the flights,” he said.
When flying in/out of Seychelles, Airtel customers will be able to use their phones only on Emirates flights. However, the in-flight roaming service is also available with the following partner airlines on selected airlines:  Etihad Airways, Gulf Air, TransAero, Lufthansa, SAS, Virgin Atlantic, Malaysian Airlines. The service will also be available in the future with KLM, Air France, Aer Lingus and Thai Airways. Customers wishing to use this service must always check with the cabin crew to confirm if the service is available on their flight.
How it works
• The in-flight roaming service is available during the “cruise” phase of flight only (i.e. after take-off and before landing).
• During the “cruise phase” you will be automatically connected to the available network. (Ensure your device is on automatic network search)
• Once connected, you can begin to make calls, send SMS and carry out data activities.
• This service is available to all postpaid customers that are subscribed to Airtel Seychelles International Roaming Service.
• To activate roaming prior to travelling, visit any Airtel Showrooms.
Notes & Tips
• Ensure your device is completely tuned off during the flight if you do not want to use the in-flight roaming service to avoid running up your bill.
• Always check with the cabin crew to confirm if the service is available on your flight
• Ensure that your phone is switched off during take-off and descent prior to landing.

Football: Airtel Cup-Ten-man Dynamo hold St Francis
27-July-2013
This was a match of poor quality between two teams who had lost their previous matches on large scores.
As St Francis went in search of their first points, Dynamo, who had conceded nine goals in two matches, almost took the lead in the sixth minute as Charles De Clarisse latched onto a through ball to rifle a shot at St Francis reserve goalie Jude Barra who parried his shot.
St Francis also had a decent chance in the 13th minute. After a mêlée in the Dynamo penalty area, the ball broke to St Francis’ Malagasy striker Hery whose strong shot was parried by Dynamo’s goalkeeper Jules Monnaie.
St Francis’ goalkeeper Barra was lucky not to be sent off on the half hour as he rushed out of his goal to mis-time his tackle on Malagasy Asman Todisoa to concede a foul and he was not even booked.
Seven minutes later, Dynamo went close from captain Evans Télémaque’s superb through-ball to Malagasy Todisoa. Goalkeeper Barra tried to intercept the ball but Todisoa collected the loose ball to cut it back to Basil Bertin whose shot was cleared on the goalline by captain Ronny Monthy.
Dynamo suffered a major setback on the stroke of half time as Stan Fanchette threaded a pass to Malagasy Branly Zizi. The Malagasy striker eluded the defence to bore on goal but he was pulled back by defender Collin Tirant for a blatant foul.
Referee Egbert Havelock was spot on as he signaled for a foul and he quite rightly dished out a straight red card to defender Tirant for pulling back the St Francis striker.
Ryan Antat drove the resulting free-kick on target but Dynamo goalkeeper Monnaie just managed to tip the ball over the crossbar.
However, Dynamo did not let the disadvantage affect them and in the 62nd minute after a scuffle in the St Francis penalty area, Marcus Maria drilled a loose ball wide with the goal at his mercy.
St Francis’ Branly Zizi was to open the scoring with a brilliant individual goal as he picked the ball from the half-way line to bore on goal. He skipped past a couple of tackles and when he reached the Dynamo penalty box, he just flashed the ball with the outside of his boot past goalkeeper Monnaie for a fantastic goal to make it 1-0.
Dynamo though almost drew level four minutes later as captain Télémaque curled in a well-worked free-kick which crashed against the post and dropped to Todisoa but the Malagasy front man was soon crowded out and the danger was cleared.
As Dynamo pushed players forward in search of an equaliser, Stephane Barallon latched onto a through ball in the 83rd minute but he shot just wide to let Dynamo off the hook.
St Francis were made to pay in the 87th minute as Dynamo’s substitute Valerio Derothé released Todisoa who coolly slotted the ball past goalkeeper Barra for a 1-1 score.
Dynamo continued to press for a winner as they won three consecutive corners in added time but just failed to find the breakthrough.
Dynamo’s coach Cliff Nolin was disappointed with his players after the match when he spoke to Sports Nation.
“My players did not listen to advice given to them in the first half. But in the second period despite playing with 10 men, we dominated our opponents but just could not find the breakthrough,” said coach Nolin.
As for St Francis’ coach Marc Mathiot, he was pleased with his team’s showing on Thursday.
“My team have shown a slight improvement from our last match. If they continue to attend training on a regular basis, they will surely show progress,” said coach Mathiot.

27-July-2013
Brigadier Payet inspecting the new recruits
They took their oath of allegiance yesterday afternoon during a passing-out ceremony held at the Seychelles Defence Academy (SDA) on South-East Island.
Present for the event were chief of defence forces Brigadier Leopold Payet, chief of staff Colonel Clifford Roseline, other SPDF senior officers, family and friends of the new recruits.

The highlight of the ceremony was the presentation of awards to the best students in both batches.
Nel Hypolite was awarded for being the best academic recruit in the first group while the same award went to Daniel Magloire from the second group.
The overall best recruit in the first batch went to Joesa Savy and Terrence Tamboo from the second group.
Steven Boniface received the award for the best outdoor recruit in group one and Adrian Barbé from group two.
The academy has also hosted various other courses to improve and develop personnel who are already in service. Those who took part in those courses received their certificates during the passing-out ceremony.
L/CPL Maria Steven received the award as the best overall performer from the group who took part in the junior non-commissioned officers.
The best overall performer award from the drivers’ cadre group went to Pt Darel Marianne.

“Your progress in the force will depend entirely on the vow and I am convinced that you will all succeed,” he added.

He was also awarded the best foreign student of his intake at the Tanzanian academy.

Health Minister Mitcy Larue’s message on the occasion of World Hepatitis Day – July 28- ‘Join hands in this national battle against hepatitis’
27-July-2013
Health Minister Mitcy Larue said this in her message on the occasion of World Hepatitis Day which will be celebrated tomorrow.
The minister’s message reads:
“Today we join the world to commemorate ‘World Hepatitis Day’ under the theme ‘This is Hepatitis. Know it. Confront it.’
“The campaign emphasises the fact that hepatitis remains largely unknown as a health threat in most parts of the world.
“According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the prevalence of hepatitis on a global scale is staggering. One in 12 people worldwide are affected by hepatitis.  That equates to over 500 million people. Over a million of these people die each year and many experience reduced quality of life as a result of chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Yet, despite these statistics, viral hepatitis still remains relatively poorly understood.
“Here in Seychelles, there are 342 people currently known to be living with chronic hepatitis B or C (26 with hepatitis B and 316 with hepatitis C) as of March 2013. Many who have not been tested may not be aware that they have the virus, because hepatitis often has no symptoms in the early stages of the disease, and consequently remains undiagnosed. This obviously creates an enormous problem, not only because of the burden hepatitis places on individuals at risk of developing liver disease but also the burden it places on the Seychelles health system.
“Since 2011, the WHO officially recognises World Hepatitis Day as a way of raising international awareness on hepatitis. This annual event demonstrates the growing concern about viral hepatitis as a global public health issue.
“In association with the theme of today’s event, firstly let’s know about it. Let’s prevent hepatitis and its related liver disease through education and hepatitis B vaccination. Each and every one of us must make it our own responsibility to sufficiently get informed and access to information, about infection, transmission and prevention of hepatitis. The government funds services to provide education and resources to raise awareness of hepatitis and vaccines to prevent hepatitis B. There are opportunities that all of us can take advantage of, from all services of the health centres, the media, internet, and in our everyday lives, to increase awareness around this issue.
“Secondly, let’s increase testing for hepatitis – both B and C viruses.
“All it requires is a simple blood test. Early detection and interventions are important to slow the progression of liver disease.
“For the second time, Seychelles is joining other nations to make this annual event one that provides international focus for vulnerable groups and people living with hepatitis. 
“Hepatitis is a hidden epidemic with significant public health consequences. This year’s theme serves to remind us that it is a disease affecting and infecting many of our citizens. We need to know of its existence in order to protect ourselves and our loved ones.
“The recent surveys undertaken in Seychelles have clearly indicated that hepatitis C infection is rapidly increasing in certain population groups, mainly people who inject drugs. These young men and women have families, they have their friends and the virus can be transmitted to them as well. Therefore this year, Seychelles is focusing mainly on hepatitis C prevention. For those of you not infected, stay uninfected and ensure you remain uninfected. Prevent yourself and those close to you from contracting it by avoiding exposure. If you are already infected, prevent transmission to others by taking all the necessary precautions.
“The razor blades used this morning … did you dispose it in a safe place where your child cannot get access to it?
“That tattoo or piercing you have been dreaming to have …is it safe? How sure can you be that the equipment being used is not infected?
“It’s little things that may cost YOU, your life or the life of the people around you!
“I therefore call upon all who believe in prevention – parents, siblings, individuals, NGOs, religious groups and other national organisations – to join hands in this national battle against hepatitis.
“Make it your duty to combat illicit drug use that remains the main mode of transmission of hepatitis C and together we shall influence real change in disease preventions.
“Let the international hepatitis day 2013 serves as a reminder that there is much more to be done to combat this silent epidemic of viral hepatitis.”

Allamanda resort staff donate blood-A single donor can save lives “be a hero”.
27-July-2013
Some of the Allamanda staff donating blood
And it was fitting enough that a group of Allamanda Beach Resort & Spa staff decided to be heroes when they donated blood on Thursday.
The event was to coincide with blood donation day in June. Unfortunately they were not ready, so they postponed it to July.
Speaking to Seychelles Nation, Rose-May Lavigne, chairperson of the care committee of Allamanda Beach Resort & Spa said: “We at Allamanda have a culture of care and donating blood forms part of the various activities the resort does to help out in the community.”
Forms were supplied to staff of the resort’s various departments and those who were interested gave their names voluntarily.
Mrs Lavigne added that the resort has organised other projects like talks about climate change, and cleaned the old people’s home at Anse Royale.
She added that the resort has an ongoing project of collecting pet bottles and the money generated from the sale will be reinvested into community projects.

Education reforms reach another milestone
27-July-2013
Minister Mondon addressing the gathering at the launch ceremony
The National Curriculum Framework 2013 replaces that launched in 2001. 
Minister Mondon said the new document establishes the principles and values that guide curriculum planning and implementation and outlines the essential competencies and life skills necessary for the development of successful lifelong learners. 
“The National Curriculum Framework also provides a richer, more flexible, inclusive and coherent structure for curriculum development to enhance learning in all our state schools,” she said.
To show the progress of curriculum and assessment development over the years two presentations were made by Elva Gedeon and Egbert Benstrong. 
Mrs Gedeon presented the history of curriculum development since before Independence during the 1970’s till the post Independence when the first National Curriculum framework was published in 2001.
Mr Benstrong said that the assessment framework will contribute immensely in determining pupil’s achievement.
The launch of the new document took place yesterday at the School of Education in the presence of Vice-President Danny Faure, Designated Minister Vincent Meriton, other ministers, Ambassador Bernard Shamlaye, principal secretaries and other government officials. 
Minister Mondon presents a copy of the new framework to Vice-President Faure
Also present were students, head teachers and teachers from various schools.
“Even if assessment is an integral component of curriculum implementation, we have developed a National Assessment Framework that provides a systematic model and more effective strategies for measurement of learning outcomes,” said Minister Mondon.
“The National Assessment Framework also provides a structure for better management of information on learners’ performance to improve teaching and learning in our schools.  Together, these two frameworks support a new vision for learning that focus on students’ need for 21st Century skills,” she added.
The minister further said that “the Division for Curriculum Assessment and Teacher Support (CCATS), in collaboration with teachers and other subject specialists, will undertake a review of different subject curricula and resources in line with the policy guidelines of the two frameworks. 
“We will ensure that schools are provided with the necessary professional support to implement the new curriculum framework.”
She also extended her appreciation to the vice-president for facilitating this collaboration as well as to all those who contributed in the growth of the two frameworks, as well as for the research work done and those who participated in the consultation sessions. 
The two frameworks will be placed on the Ministry of Education’s website to make them available to all.  The different partners and schools were also presented with an example of the two frameworks.
A small sketch was also performed by three students of the Mont Fleuri secondary school, to show their understanding of what the two frameworks encompass.

Mancham and SIF join forces on Aldabra project-• ‘Potential for a formidable partnership’
27-July-2013
The projects’ ultimate aim is to give Seychellois and international visitors the opportunity to remotely experience one of the world’s environment of wonders
The decision to form this partnership came about following a meeting between Ambassador Maurice Loustau-Lalanne, chairman of the SIF, the foundation which has for sometimes now been engaged in promoting an Aldabra House project and Mr Mancham, who announced on July 24 his decision to spearhead the development of an Aldabra Centre for Mahé.
The Aldabra House project was announced by Ambassador Loustau-Lalanne when he spoke at the Aldabra 30th anniversary celebration in December last year. 
He introduced the Aldabra House project as a world class visitor centre and ecological attraction which will bring Aldabra to Mahé, giving Seychellois and our many international visitors the opportunity to remotely experience one of the world’s environment of wonders. 
Mr Mancham’s decision to move along these lines and spearhead what he described as an Aldabra Centre that will give the opportunity of an Aldabra experience to Seychellois and visitors followed a visit to Prague where he enlisted the support of the director and others involved in the production of a 3D film on Aldabra.
“Sir James’ support will give rise to the opportunity of an exciting national and international partnership in the building of an iconic and unique centre,” Ambassador Loustau-Lalanne has stated.
As a matter of fact there has been a wide amount of praise for the idea both locally and internationally.
On July 22, President James A. Michel commended Mr Mancham’s initiative and assured him of his support towards the project materialisation. 
“I must say I was impressed with the concept elaborated and I am of the opinion that such a centre could stand out as a monumental achievement for Seychelles.  It is certainly in line with my policy of creating a greater Seychelles during my presidency,” President Michel wrote.
He also welcomed the fact that Sir James and Ambassador Loustau-Lalanne were exploring the avenues of collaboration for the realisation of a joint project.
Among the praise from abroad for the idea is one from Fred Oladeinde, President of the Foundation of Democracy in Africa, in Washington DC, USA:
“I am very much interested in learning about the Aldabra Centre and how we can support with outreach and public education on the project.  We will be delighted to host an outreach for Aldabra in Washington DC in the future with partner organisations,” he wrote.
In a meeting held on Thursday, the parties have agreed to constitute at this time a working group under the joint chairmanship of Sir James and Ambassador Loustau-Lalanne with the objective of overseeing the implementation of the project.  
“SIF hopes that this initiative will bring together the public and private sector not only locally but also internationally to support the project and to contribute towards the continued protection of Aldabra as a world heritage,” Ambassador Loustau-Lalanne commented.
“We are of course delighted to have Sir James with us and look forward to a successful partnership,” he added.
With Sir James’ extensive international experience and SIF pioneering and scientific research background, the potential is certainly there for a formidable partnership.

Patrick will also be there on that day and there will be surprises at the end of the show,” said Next Step spokesperson Sonny Dogley.
“Patrick has performed in a lot for charity shows to help people who are in need. Now he needs our support.

The companies that support the cause will be given free publicity on a banner to be unveiled at the show,” he added.
Proceeds from the show will go to Patrick Octave and Andre Cedras, who is also a singer living at the North East Point hospital.

'Christmas with the Stars' evening to launch end-of-year festivities
27-July-2013
Minister St Ange during the meeting with the organising committee for the December 7 event
The ‘Christmas with the Stars’ evening will be staged on Francis Rachel Street in front of the National Cultural Centre on Saturday December 7.
This was announced this week by the Minister for Tourism and Culture Alain St Ange during a meeting of the organising committee which comprises performing artists, musicians, choir directors and representatives from the culture department, National Arts Council, Mayor’s office as well as churches.
Minister St Ange said the aim of his ministry is to mark the 2013 end-of-year festivities with an evening with a difference. 
"We need to work with the community of artists, and we need to work with our country's choirs to make this 2013 end-of-year festivities one that will set the stage for the years to come. Christmas and the end-of-year celebrations remain dear to us as a people and as a country, and we owe to ourselves and to our country to provide a launch of these celebrations where families, young couples, the elderly can all come together for a musical spectacle with Christmas songs, carols and end-of-year songs by our professionals accompanied by budding artists. We all know when the community of artists decide to come together what magical an evening they can stage for Seychelles," he said.
At the meeting, members agreed that the time is right for everyone to come together to give Seychelles a family evening out with entertainment, fun and end-of-year Christmas and New Year songs we all have loved and cherished throughout our lives.
They echoed their commitment for the 'Christmas with the Stars' evening and agreed to come together for a spectacular night on December 7 which everyone hopes will also be the date when the decorative lights through Victoria will be switched on.
The artists have also agreed to make use of the stage and décor which will be set up at the National Cultural Centre to animate Victoria all through this year’s festive season. They will also seize the opportunity to sell their CDs.
The show will be produced by Jimmy Savy and the organisers have promised some real surprises for that evening where Victoria will see a display with artists arriving on stage by means never seen before, and even Father Christmas and angels will be coming down from the sky!

Ministry of Education: Remaining connected with our partners- Education ministry engages parents in consultative meetings
27-July-2013
The meetings form part of the ministry’s efforts to ensure that key partners, in this case parents, are regularly consulted and provided with the opportunity to express their concerns and also make other contributions.
The meetings are being held at district level and bring together parents of the districts’ secondary schools along with feeder primary schools in the vicinity in order to ensure vital information is brought closer to the parents. This also allows particular issues to be addressed in a more specific manner in some case issues which are unique to certain districts or some schools. 
So far parents from over 15 schools have been consulted between June 25 and July 26 and the ministry has described the responses and recommendations made by parents as encouraging and highly beneficial.
Addressing challenges and celebrating success together
The meetings also allow the ministry to discuss the academic performances of the relevant schools with parents while also recognising and identifying challenges that need to be addressed for the specific communities.
The Ministry of Education seized the opportunity to congratulate parents for the support they are giving to the school management and teachers.
However, in some instances primarily with regards to parents’ involvement in their children’s studies, there is room for improvement.
With busy schedules and living in a ‘globalised world’ and following a fast-pace lifestyle, it is important for parents to allocate adequate time to discuss school matters with their children, and encourage them to take their studies seriously at a very early age.
Parents’ role in the fight against underage drinking
Parents are regarded as one of the key partners of education in the fight against underage drinking and it is in this same line that the series of meetings are also geared towards educating, raising awareness and enlisting the support of parents to join forces with the ministry to address issues related to early alcohol consumption by youths and its impacts.
During the meetings, parents are also being educated on the increasing dangers alcohol has on the lives of young people through a presentation entitled ‘Alcohol in the life of teens’ by Dr Daniella Malulu, consultant in charge of the Anse Royale Wellness Centre.
Ministry maintains yearly rendez-vous with school council chairpersons
The school council chairpersons’ meetings are held three times a year. Council chairpersons kept their second rendez-vous with the ministry for the second meeting organised recently.
Held at the School of Education’s auditorium, Mont Fleuri, these meetings are part of a series of scheduled meetings for 2013 that give school council chairpersons an opportunity to meet the education senior management, share information and discuss pertinent education matters.
Social renaissance in the education sector
A number of factors have been identified for the anti-social behaviour of students and challenges faced by teachers, parents and students. Through the series of consultative meetings, the ministry has started implementing the education sector social renaissance plan.
With the support and partnership of the department of social affairs, parents are also being educated through the various presentations and discussions.
The following are some of the photos taken during the meetings.

Seychelles lives up to even the highest expectations, says Abode 2 magazine
27-July-2013
The article entitled ‘Seychelles Serenade’ printed in the Adobe 2 magazine depicts Seychelles as ‘the destination’
The islands have received coverage through 10 pages in the summer issue of the magazine which brings readers the finest in luxury resort properties around the world.
Besides the destination, two other properties have received coverage, namely Desroches Island and Eden Island.
Entitled ‘Seychelles Serenade’, the destination article describes the islands as an image of near-clichéd perfection, with sandy beaches, shady palms and warm, turquoise waters.
But the writer, James Sinclair, also says that the sun-kissed Seychelles has so much more to offer.
He describes Mahé as the ‘perfect base to explore local life beyond the sun lounger’, with ‘must-do’ visits to the capital Victoria, the National Museum of History and Botanical Gardens.
From Mahé, he says visitors can island hop and discover other hidden treasures on islands like Silhouette, Praslin and La Digue.
The writer also dedicates part of the coverage to the main events in Seychelles such as the Eco-Healing Marathon, Carnaval International de Victoria, Creole Festival and Subios (Seychelles Festival of the Sea).
In the Eden Island coverage, writer Serena Templeton describes the property as “fast approaching its place as a modern-day haven of exotic delights” while Laura Henderson has this to say about Desroches Island Private: “Move over the Maldives, the Seychelles is the latest tropical hotspot selling a slice of freehold paradise.”

Minister visits two Praslin hotels
27-July-2013
The aims of the visits are for her ministry to familiarise itself with the workings of the private sector while at the same time building and maintaining a strong relationship by ensuring that the employment laws of Seychelles are being observed.
First to be visited was the Paradise Sun Hotel where the delegation was greeted by general manager Philippe Bethune, human resources manager Annabelle Hoareau and front office manager Irene Robert. The ministerial delegation was taken on a guided tour of all the departments.
During her visit, Minister Alexander had the opportunity to speak to various members of the staff from all departments who readily shared their work experience, achievements and constraints which concerned mainly their salaries.
During the debriefing, Minister Alexander touched on the points that were raised by staff members during her visit. The management team was encouraged to establish a salary structure that is well defined in order to bridge the gap between the salary of non-Seychellois and Seychellois workers.
She also pointed out the importance of having a training plan, a retention policy with good incentives and performance appraisals conducted at appropriate times in order to identify training needs and for rewarding good performance.
She added that this will boost staff morale and in turn increase job satisfaction, thus creating a more conducive work environment.
The minister ended by commending the hotel for providing opportunities to local staff to occupy supervisory positions.
Mr Bethune thanked the minister and her officials for visiting the hotel and said that he is ready to work closely with the ministry in order to address all the points discussed.
For the second visit, the ministerial delegation went to the Cote D’Or Lodge where they were met by general manager Marco Zinna and his deputy Steven Baronne, who provided them with a tour of the hotel.
Staff members were given the opportunity to interact with the minister and put forward their concerns, which focussed on training opportunities, shortage of staff in certain areas and lack of communication between staff and management.
During the debriefing, the minister stressed that communication among the staff and with the heads of department is essential.
She added that everyone should try to communicate and resolve their problems internally.
The management staff was urged to compile and forward their localisation plan in time for it to be incorporated in the National Human Resource Plan.
The discussions also focussed around training where the minister asked the hotel to submit its training plan so that the NHRDC (National Human Resource Development Council) can assist the staff in getting the same training opportunities that is offered to staff in the tourism sector on Mahé.
She ended by asking the management staff to carry out their respective duties conscientiously and to the best of their abilities.
Mr Zinna on his part thanked the ministerial delegation for coming to visit the depot and said that he is looking forward to having a long and productive relationship with the ministry.
The accompanying photos show Minister Alexander and her delegation during her visits to the two establishments.

Seychelles, Mauritius qualify for second phase
26-July-2013

The first matches are slated for this afternoon at the Palais des Sports. The women’s game is at 5pm followed by the men’s at 7pm.
Confederation of African Volleyball (CABV) technical official, Mauritian Kaysee Teeroovengadum told Sports Nation yesterday that although Seychelles and Mauritius have already qualified for the second stage of the zone seven qualifiers as the other countries declined to take part, they had to play at least one match.
But the Seychelles Volleyball Federation (SVF) decided to have three matches instead to give local volleyball fans the opportunity to see our teams in action.
The last time the Seychelles women’s and men’s teams played in front of their public was at the 8th Indian Ocean Island Games in 2011 on home soil when they won the gold medals against Reuinionnais opponents.
 The second set of matches will be played tomorrow at 4pm and 6pm followed by Sunday at the same times.
The second stage of the qualifiers will be held in Mauritius, but the dates and playing format are yet to be revealed by the CAVB.
The winners of the second stage of the zone seven qualifiers will join 11 other teams from Africa – one from zone 1 and two from zones 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 – where they will be drawn into two pools of six. The two pool winners will represent Africa at the women’s World Championships which will be contested by 24 teams.
 Hosts Italy have already qualified, while defending champions Russia, who will looking for a third consecutive triumph, will also take part in the qualifiers.
The distribution by confederation for the 2014 FIVB women's world championships is as follows: Asia (four places), Africa (two places), Europe (nine places + Italy qualified automatically as host nation for a total of 10 places), South America (two places) and North, Central America and Caribbean (six places).
The FIVB women's World Championship is held every four years and the last tourney was hosted by Japan in 2010. Russia won their second straight title by Olympic champions Brazil 3-2 (21-25, 25-17, 20-25, 25-14, 15-11) in a five-set marathon to win the gold medal in front of a full house of 12,000 fans at the Yoyogi National Stadium in Tokyo.
Like the Seychelles women’s team, the men’s have to beat Mauritius in stage two of the zone seven qualifiers to progress to the third round where they will join the other 11 African teams from zone 1 and two from zones 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Following a draw, the 12 teams will play in three groups of four and the three group winners will make it to word championships in Poland in 2014.
The distribution by confederation for the 2014 FIVB men's world championships is as follows: Asia (four places), Africa (three places), Europe (eight places + Poland qualified automatically as host nation for a total of nine places), South America (three places) and North, Central America and Caribbean (five places). The country’s men’s team are coached by James Camille and his assistant is François Ally, while Nichol Lesperance is the women’s team head coach and Marie-Ange Bouchereau his assistant.

Football-Cosafa tournament was just incredible, says Patel
26-July-2013

Speaking to Sports Nation in an exclusive interview, Mr Patel said the tournament generated interest that was just unbelievable, be it in terms of TV and media interest as well as the Zambian people and the African continent as a whole.
“There is no doubt there was a lot of work to get this tournament off the ground. We needed lots of money and sponsorship to give this tournament visibility. It was complicated to bring the TV broadcasting up to international standard which required lots of negotiation, but the end product was just incredible as it was on a par with the Cup of Nations,” reflected the Cosafa president.
Mr Patel revealed that it required one year of hard work where they started off with only one third of the money that was needed. 
However, Mr Patel is pleased that in partnership with the sponsors, this association has made enough money to sustain Cosafa for a couple of years.
“The sponsors have realised that we have a marketable product and we showed our main sponsor – Castle – that we can organise such a competition and what we have achieved is beyond expectation.
“As a result we have secured their sponsorship for the next three years though we are still broadening our scope as we seek more sponsors. But what is important is at the end of this tournament when we talk to both the local and international sponsors, they were all very happy,” Mr Patel noted.
Mr Patel though accepts that they faced a few difficulties before the tournament started, especially with teams pulling out as well as rescheduling of TV broadcast of matches.
“The good thing though is once the tournament commenced everything ran smoothly. We also had a great host country as the Zambian government came to the party and was very supportive,” Mr Patel said in appreciation.
The Cosafa president was especially pleased with the good attendance at the matches which kept growing as the tournament entered its second week and the excitement level rising.
“This tournament had a worldwide reach as Supersport were providing live broadcast of matches and other media such as the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Fox News were constantly reporting on this event. We registered 17,763 tweets while they recorded 4,764 articles in print media with 4,883 articles appearing online and 2,752 number of stories created on the Facebook page,” Mr Patel revealed.
The former Seychelles Football Federation (SFF) boss stated that he is very happy the way things went and praised his executive committee who worked hard to make things happen.
“As part of our social responsibility, when we go to such host countries, we choose people from different countries to develop them in capacity building. We also continued with the programme ‘United Against Malaria’ during this tournament. It started as a small project but has now taken a massive dimension. We also had the different teams taking part in the social responsibility programme during the tournament and it was a big success,” said Mr Patel.
The former Seychelles goalkeeper also stressed on the importance of the Cosafa tournament which has been revived this year after it was last held in 2009.
He claimed that the idea was to help small countries develop and get competition so as to help raise their level.
When he was asked what lies ahead for Cosafa, Mr Patel said that he will be meeting TV company Supersport and main sponsor Castle in August as they try to organise a club championship competition for this region with a 15 million rand budget.
 
The Cosafa president will also see if Malawi will adhere to its agreement to host the tournament which will become an annual event as well as ask other countries who are interested to also send their bids.
Having enjoyed the tournament’s organisation, Mr Patel was asked by Sports Nation to comment on our national team’s showing and he had this to say:
“I was disappointed with both matches as mentally our players need to get themselves right and motivation must come from within. We could have beaten the Namibians but against the Mauritians, the mental attitude was just not right. I also think that coach Jan Mak tried to change things too quickly which was a mistake. But one also wonders if he was well advised or did his other management team just sit back and let him do his own thing? I think that in such tournament one must go with tried players but not try to experiment too much.”
Nonetheless, Mr Patel was filled with pride to see one of our officials – Bernard Camille – take charge of the final match involving Zambia and Zimbabwe.
“Bernard was among the top three referees at the tournament but he got the edge due to different circumstances. There is no doubt he is an excellent referee and among Confederation of African Football’s future stars. He managed to showcase his ability to go further and it is a fact that our officials work really hard even harder than our players and they can see the results and they must always show consistency,” Mr Patel pointed out.
In conclusion, Mr Patel said he is happy of the work he is doing for African football and feels he made a mistake in attempting to be elected to the Fédération internationale de Football Association (Fifa) executive committee last time, adding he won’t stand again as he sits on the Fifa audit and compliance committee.
“I like what I do for Africa and I am happy with my work here and to be close to my family,” Mr Patel exclaimed.
Surely Mr Patel must be credited for such a wonderful tournament and we all take pride in what our Seychellois colleague has achieved at such a high level as head of Cosafa.

Bodybuilding-Two top competitions confirmed
26-July-2013

Caretaker committee chairman Ted Sauzier has told Sports Nation that they have already secured a deal to organise the Mr Regatta competition in September.
“On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank Ray Hoareau, a member of the Regatta organising committee, who approached us to organise this competition. We will be meeting soon to finalise the date of the Mr Regatta tournament,” said chairman Sauzier.
Mr Sauzier also claimed that they are planning to organise one of the top competitions – the Mr Seychelles contest – at the end of October to coincide with the Festival Kreol.
“We will have a final meeting with the culture department so that the Mr Seychelles competition is included in the list of Festival Kreol activities,” added Mr Sauzier.
He added that he has travelled to Praslin with some of his committee members to meet the manager of Praslin Beach hotel and Casino des Iles where they have agreed in principle to host a competition in November.
Mr Sauzier described his committee’s visit to Praslin as “very fruitful”.
“We also plan to meet all the athletes as at the moment we are posting information in the different gyms where they train. But we are preparing to bring them together to brief them on the rules and regulations of competition which we have amended. This will be done by Golbert Nicette and Michael Etienne,” revealed chairman Sauzier.
According to Mr Sauzier, they will inform the bodybuilders on disciplinary rules regarding the sport and for every competition.
“All in all we are progressing well and we hope we continue to get the support from everyone to help put this sport back on its feet,” said chairman Sauzier.
This sport has been allowed to divide athletes for too long, but hopefully a new dawn awaits this power sport where the athletes will put aside their differences to compete under one united association.
Let us hope the National Sports Council will also provide them the necessary help, especially in terms of funding to get them back on track.

777 prevail in first ever super-over in Seychelles cricket
26-July-2013
Winning the toss, Patel Youth captain decided to bowl first. 777 openers Krishna and
Nataraj gave them a solid start. However, Krishna fell for 13 and Nataraj was dismissed after scoring 16 runs.

Upcoming batsmen Suranga and Parthi built on the platform laid by the openers. After Suranga was run out for 23 runs, Vignesh came in and gave Parthi good support with his contribution of 26 runs.

 However, the main big knock was played by Parthi who was unbeaten on 61 runs (5 fours and 5 sixes). At the end of the 1st innings, 777 had put on a total of 156 runs for the loss of 5 wickets.

For Patel Youth, Dharmesh picked up 3 wickets for 36 runs whereas Ajit bowled economically, conceding 14 runs in his 4 overs without picking up a wicket though.
The Patel Youth run chase was off to a shaky start losing openers Naresh and Nitin for 1 and 7 runs respectively. Then the upcoming batsmen, Hitesh and Bharat, stabilised the situation, putting on a solid 3rd wicket partnership.
Hitesh was dismissed for 11 runs whereas Bharat smashed 45 runs which included 7 sixes. After the dismissal of Hitesh, the two upcoming batsmen – Vijesh and Paresh – could not get set and were dismissed cheaply.
Patel Youth were back in the game after Dharmesh came in and scored 17 runs, giving Bharat good support. However, there was another twist in the tale after the fall of these two batsmen as Ravinder picked up two wickets in one over including the big one of Bharat.
Ultimately it came down to Sanjay who scored 36 runs dashing 777’s hopes of bowling out Patel Youth who were also given support by Prakash who chipped in with 13 runs.
The match went down to the wire with Patel Youth requiring 4 runs of the last over. The huge task of bowling the last over was given to Sabir. Despite bowling 3 wides in the last over the Patel Youth batsmen facing the last over could not clear the infield or steal a single as the match ended in a tie.
For 777, Seenu was the pick of the bowlers picking up 4 wickets for just 14 runs and Krishna also picked up 1 for 20.
To decide the winners, the match went into the super over where Patel Youth had to bat first. Seenu bowled the super over for 777 conceding only 11 runs which came off Bharat’s bat and picked up the wicket of Dharmesh.
After bowling an economical spell in the 1st innings, Ajit was given the task to defend 11 runs in the super over. Parthi hit a 6 on the first ball of the super over but was bowled by Ajit on the next ball.
After coming in to bat at number 3, Suranga sneaked a quick single giving the strike to Nataraj. Requiring 5 runs to win, Nataraj made the winning runs on the fifth ball of the over by hitting Ajit for a six to win a thriller of a contest for 777.
777 will play the final of the tournament against Vijay ‘A’ on July 28 at the Roche Caïman playing field. The match will starts at 9.30am.

60th anniversary of Moncada-Secufa sends greetings to Cuban people
26-July-2013
Secufa recognises that, historically, this event was the spark that brought about the final triumph of the Cuban Revolution.

On this date, July 26 of 1953, a young Fidel Castro led some 160 men on an assault on the military barracks of Moncada and Carlos Manuel de Cespedes in Santiago de Cuba and Bayamo respectively.

 Although a disappointing failure, this action would be remembered and celebrated as the first true act of rebelliousness of the Cuban youth against tyranny.
The Day of Rebelliousness, as it is now called, is one of Cuba’s most memorable and important dates and is celebrated every year as a National Holiday. The festivities this year will be concentrated in the heroic city of Santiago de Cuba.
Secufa will commemorate the Day of Rebelliousness next week, on August 3, in a politico-social evening that will bring together members and friends of the association, members of the Cuban community residing in Seychelles, and members of the Cuban Brigade who are on internationalist assignments in our country.
Secufa wishes all Cubans, wherever they may be, a Happy National Day.

Line 1.3 On sales of capital assets: Column A will reflect the selling price of any fixed asset sold by a business and column B the Vat charged on this sale.  
Line 2: Exempt supplies
Column A: As exempt supplies are not taxable, column A will show the total value of exempt goods and services sold during the taxable period. Example: sale of infant formulae, rice and lentils by a retailer.
Line 3:  Adjustments
Column B: Reflects adjustments increasing or reducing the amount of output vat. It includes correction of errors made during the last period (example an editing error).    
Adjustments also include credit notes issued when the price of a supply has reduced after a tax invoice was issued, e.g. the return of faulty goods; debit notes issued when the price increases after a tax invoice has been issued.
Line 4: Total output tax
Column B: Reflects the total amount of Vat collected on taxable sales (line 1B + 1.3B + 3B). This is the total output tax against which the deductible input tax will be offset. It is important to fill this line in.

Parents learn about dangers of alcohol abuse in children
26-July-2013

Education principal secretary Merida Delcy made these comments this week during a meeting with parents of students of the Belonie, La Rosière and Bel Eau primary schools as well as the Belonie secondary school. 
The meeting, which is the third in a series of meetings organised by the Ministry of Education, was held at the Baha’i centre at Bel Air in the presence of the Minister for Social Affairs, Community Development and Sports Vincent Meriton and principal secretary for social development Linda William-Melanie and other ministry officials from the Ministry of Education.
A large crowd of parents made the effort to attend the meeting aimed at discussing problems the schools are facing, especially with alcohol and other substance abuse.
“The most common use of alcohol by the youth are the spirits, for example ‘Pti Ponm’ as it is commonly known, and this represents a major challenge for parents as well as the schools as the students are affected academically,” Mrs Delcy told the parents.
Principal secretary William-Melanie also stated that we need to understand the context of life we are living in now in order for us to understand the children.
Dr Daniella Malulu gave an elaborated presentation on the dangers of alcohol drinking in children and how their body and brain development is impaired with its effects.
Recommendations were also shared with parents in regards to the symposium held against the fight of alcohol.

Letter to the Editor-‘Refusal of access’ issue calls for more debate and consideration
26-July-2013
I personally welcome this statement as I have received many complaints by Seychellois of different walks of life concerning their refusal of access to certain hotels in the country.
In the greater picture of things, the happiness and contentment of the Seychellois people must be the ultimate aim of any tourism or government policy. There can be no justification, economic or otherwise, for any policy or practice which vitiates the overriding imperative of promoting and consolidating a culture of harmony within the Nation.
However, the issue is more complicated in practice than one may primarily assume. For one, there is unfortunately a big problem of alcohol and other abuses which very often results into unreasonable, if not, offensive behaviour. There is also the prevalence of petty thieving which is illustrated on a daily basis by the nature of cases which are brought to the Magistrates attention.
Then, there is the prevalence of a confusing dressing code in the country. For example, at a recent conference, some participants were dressed in long shirts with a tie, another in a long shirt without a tie who was seated next to someone in a t-shirt, who was himself seated next to someone in a suit. Certainly, with its international clientele, a hotel must be allowed to decide on its dressing code. Many people look forward to dinner as it provides them and their spouse with the opportunity to dress in style and fashion and they would not be happy to have next to them a couple in swimwear!
Obviously, the issue needs more debate and consideration so that we can finally come up with an overall policy that can command the support of the general community as well as that of hotels management.
I would like to recall that during my presidency, we said ‘no’ to a Club Mediterrané Resort because their strict exclusivity policy would have given rise to many allegations of discrimination in our multi-coloured society. All told, we must also be mindful that there is a tendency in our society for some who are of nuisance value to cry “colour bar” whenever they are disciplined.

Assembly votes for review in CAA appointment
26-July-2013
The CAA is the body which names constitutional appointees such as judges, the electoral commissioner, ombudsman and the auditor general.
This came through a motion presented by the leader of government business in the Assembly, Marie-Antoinette Rose, during Tuesday’s sitting.
Presenting the motion, Ms Rose said that at a time when work is ongoing to revise the Constitution of Seychelles, the motion was a very important and historic one.
She said it was essential in a modern democracy for the National Assembly to review the Constitution in order to reply to the aspirations of the Seychellois people.
She explained that it was thus necessary for the Assembly to address further dysfunctions as permitted by article 102 of the Constitution.
Among the ill practices where redress is needed, Ms Rose mentioned that as some autonomous institutions never made themselves accountable for their actions, it was necessary for them to present an annual report to the Assembly, in the same way as the President’s state-of-the-nation address or the auditor general’s report.
She also asked that all details pertaining to the functioning mechanisms of the CAA are published and made public.
Most importantly, she moved that the present three-member CAA -- of which two members are nominated by the two main political parties in the National Assembly and who in turn nominate a chairperson -- becomes a five-member authority to include one from the bar association and another from the civil society.
She said that in present circumstances, the chairperson has too much power as he or she has the decisive voting right in case of disagreement among the two other members.
Kevin Vidot, the elected MNA for English River who seconded the motion and all other members who took the floor, spoke in favour of the change.
They said that it was time for the Assembly to exert its real power and by means of motions propose changes as guaranteed by the Constitution.
They argued that like parliament has to approve ministerial appointments, it should also have a say in constitutional appointments.
They also reminded that the Assembly has the power to investigate and vote out a public commissioner upon recommendations made by a tribunal named by the Speaker.
Agreeing that criteria for constitutional appointments should not only include qualification and experience but also honesty, integrity and freedom from political consideration, all members present voted in favour of the motion.
At Tuesday’s sitting, the National Assembly also voted in favour of another motion brought by the elected member for Takamaka, Alderic Bristol, asking that the government seriously considers installing mini sewage treatment plants at housing estates with the aim of having a more efficient and economically friendly treatment and disposal system.

Jouel declares mission accomplished for autism project
26-July-2013
Speaking to the media at a press briefing on Wednesday, managing director Rod Thorrington
said his company initiated the corporate social responsibility (CSR) project in 2012 in collaboration with the Seychelles Children’s Foundation (SCF).
The main objective of the autism advocacy project was to create awareness about autism and explain to the public how prevalent autism is in Seychelles’ society.
“One year later, we feel the objective has been achieved,” he said. “There has been a lot of press and television coverage, and a lot of educational material has been created. We found an unbelievable number of people coming forward and saying they suspected their child may have some degree of autism. That kind of feedback has been immense.”
Now that they feel their objective has been achieved, Jouel helped to create an association led by parents of children with autism called Pearl Seychelles, which then took over the advocacy work from this year onwards.
“This is just a statement from us to say that we have achieved our objectives, we’ve handed over but will continue to support the advocacy project,” said Mr Thorrington. “For example, we are still bringing out the professor at our own expense from America, who is an expert on autism, for a follow-up session.”
The managing director said that in terms of the parents’ association, Jouel was playing a more behind-the-scenes role, providing technical help rather than being the front-runners of the project. The company is now planning to move on to its next corporate social responsibility project.
“We’re looking at a few,” he said. “We haven’t identified one as yet, but by the end of this year we’ll have chosen one.”
“But we’re willing to take the same approach; take something that no-one knows about and that there is no support for, nurture it and then hand it over to people who are really involved in it on a personal level. We can’t have the same passion about the autism project as the parents can, and that’s why we realised that at some point we needed to hand over.”
Mr Thorrington said that the next CSR project did not necessarily have to be relating to children.
 
“The criterion is that it should be something that there is currently no interest in. With the autism project, nobody was behind it at all. Nobody wanted to talk about it. Parents who had autistic children were ashamed and worried to come out and say their child was autistic, and now the attitudes have changed completely, which was the objective.”
Since its inception in Seychelles in 2003, Jouel has grown to a chain of 10 retail jewellery outlets and recently announced its partnership with local jewellery manufacturer Kreol’Or, which it intends to grow further as a uniquely Seychellois brand and eventually export to Southern African, Middle Eastern and Asian markets.

Import fines under the spotlight at customs-• Accusations of favouritism for large importers emerge
26-July-2013

Minister Pierre Laporte made these remarks while on a visit to the customs area at New Port yesterday, where he interacted with customs officials and discussed issues surrounding their work.
The minister was accompanied on his visit by the principal secretary for Finance, Steve Fanny, as well as the commissioner of the Seychelles Revenue Commission Jennifer Morel, the assistant commissioner of the Customs Division, Selwyn Knowles and the director of sea port operations, Alberta Morel.
A number of customs staff raised concerns about what they perceived to be special treatment for certain individuals and companies regarding the waiving of import fines.
“There are a lot of cases where we issue 100% fines to certain people for not having the correct documentation, for instance, and these fines continually get waived or reduced to 25%. We feel very discouraged when we see this,” said one of the customs officials.
Ms Morel, who investigates the appeal of fines and makes a final recommendation to the assistant commissioner and commissioner, confirmed that there had been occasions that she had recommended the fines remain at 100%, but said they had been waived completely by Mr Knowles.
The assistant commissioner defended his decisions by stating that he considered mitigating factors, such as whether it was a first-time offence or the fine was the result of an administrative error on the part of the supplier of the goods.
“We always look at the case on its merits,” said Mr Knowles. “If the person is a first-time offender, we might give him a warning.”
However, the minister warned the assistant commissioner in no uncertain terms that decisions on appeals had to be applied consistently in order to avoid situations where a perception was created that some importers were given preferential treatment compared to others.
“We need to look at developing patterns,” said Mr Laporte. “If you see this is not the first time or the second time, but it is happening on multiple occasions that the documentation is being ‘lost’ or ‘forgotten’ then you need to start fining them accordingly.”
Many of the other issues raised were to do with the implementation of the Asycuda World software system, which is an upgrade to the previous software, Asycuda ++.
Complaints ranged from the extra work created from the need for physical verification of goods to the automatic allocation of bills of entry to customs officials.
“Unfortunately we are in the transition phase now, which is proving to be challenging,” said Mr Laporte. “We have had a lot of complaints from everyone, but once the transition period is over things will run a lot more smoothly.”
It was also discussed that the implementation of the new system, including the need for physical verification of contents had slowed the system down significantly, and some customs officials raised concerns about being given orders at times from the assistant commissioner to release goods without verification.
Mr Knowles said that these orders had to be given in exceptional circumstances based on a risk system that identified certain large-scale frequent importers as “safe” to allow goods to be released without inspection in urgent circumstances.
“This is only the case now that we have a backlog because of the new system,” interjected Mr Laporte. “Once the transition phase is over and everything is running smoothly again, there will be no need to release goods without verification.”
Mr Knowles confirmed that if he gave customs staff an order to release a container without verification, the responsibility for the decision would remain his alone should any problems arise.
Mr Laporte thanked the staff for their honesty and forthrightness and said that in future he would meet with a small group of representatives from the customs workers every three months to assess the progress and efficacy of the system.

“We pray for the good health of the young Prince and we join you both in celebration of this new life.
"This historic event is a reminder of the hope and joy Your Highnesses bring to the people of the Commonwealth.
"We remember fondly your visits to Seychelles – especially your honeymoon which was a great honour for our small country which, like you, attaches the greatest importance to the conservation of the environment.  We look forward to welcoming you back to our shores.”
President Michel extended the well wishes of the people and government of Seychelles to the entire Royal Family as they celebrate this memorable occasion.

World Bank report-January disaster cost over R100m
25-July-2013
 
In addition, the senior disaster risk management specialist at the World Bank, Doekle Wielinga, has said that the total costs could run as high as R378 million due to additional preventative measures to ensure that the same problems were not experienced should disaster strike again.
The World Bank, in conjunction with the Department of Risk and Disaster Management (DRDM), has presented a Damage and Loss Assessment (Dala) of the disaster caused by flooding and landslides in the wake of Cyclone Felleng.
The report was handed over to Vice-President Danny Faure; Designated Minister for Social Affairs, Community Development and Sport Vincent Meriton; Minister for Home Affairs and Transport Joel Morgan; Health Minister Mitcy Larue and Environment and Energy Minister Rolph Payet at State House on Tuesday.
The Dala methodology used by the World Bank bases its assessments on the overall economy of the affected country. It assesses the damage of totally or partially destroyed physical assets, losses in the flows of the economy that arise from the temporary absence of the damaged assets, and the resultant impact on post-disaster macroeconomic performance.
“After the January floods, the vice-president sent a letter to the World Bank, asking for support in conducting the assessment,” said Mr Wielinga.
“The Seychelles government was aware that the World Bank supports countries after major disasters by doing comprehensive impact assessments.”
Mr Wielinga mobilised a team of experts, and work commenced with collating information from relevant ministries over four main areas -- the productive sector, which includes industry, agriculture and tourism, the infrastructure sector, including transport, water and energy, the social sector, which comprises housing, education and health and the “cross-cutting” sector which focuses on disaster risk management, environment and gender issues.
“Then we needed to see how the floods had impacted the affected districts and while doing that, we also reached out to our colleagues in the EU delegation as well as in the UN for assistance with reviewing the document and providing assistance with the methodology training,” he said.
Approximately 70% of the estimated cost was physical damage and 30% were calculated as economic losses, brought about by the loss of incomes suffered by the victims of the damage to property or the inability to conduct business due to disruptions in transport, communications and other essential services.
Once the team had calculated the damages and losses, they began to identify the needs around reconstruction.
“A good example of this was the school at Pointe Larue, which was completely flooded,” said Mr Wielinga. “Of course, you can clean the school, you can fumigate it, which was done, but the recommendation was that in the coming five years, a new location should be sought, and the whole school should actually be rebuilt in that new location.”
“So you spend a bit more money but you have a safe place for the school, and you know that the children will not be affected if there is suddenly a flash flood or a landslide. Therefore, the needs governing reconstruction are actually much higher over a period of several years,” he said.
Minister Meriton, who chaired the task force set up by President James Michel in the wake of the January disaster, said the money raised by the National Disaster Relief Fund, which amounted to approximately R40 million, had already been committed to various reconstruction projects.
“In view of this, we need to look for solutions of how government is going to find the money to meet the total reconstruction costs, because we cannot start a project and not finish it. So we are currently finalising a plan with the Minister for Finance to get additional funding.”
Minister Payet said the World Bank team was also providing much-needed assistance vital for the understanding of how to better prepare for disasters in the future, especially in terms of financial preparedness to meet the demands of mitigating the risks of disaster and being able to find the funding to respond quickly and efficiently should one occur.

Kevin Betsy donates football equipment to schools
25-July-2013

Betsy, who once played for Fulham in the English Premier League, made the donation in a small ceremony at the Belonie secondary school yesterday afternoon. The equipment comprise Fulham kits which include shirts, shorts, socks and footballs as well.
Attended by officials from the Seychelles Football Federation (SFF), students and teachers from both schools, a group of students had the time reflect and give thanks for the gifts received.
 
Mr Betsy had wise words for the students telling them “you achieve anything you want in life with dedication and making the most of the opportunity”.
He said that through his donation he is aiding in giving the young footballers the chance to achieve their dreams.
Medgé Nancy, head teacher of Belonie secondary school, thanked Mr Betsy and the SFF for the donation and said that she hopes the students will make the most of the equipment received.
Ms Nancy added that she hopes the school will continue to receive support from the federation.
On behalf of the students, young Santosh Albert also thanked Mr Betsy for his generous act, adding he hopes for continued support towards his school.
The Belonie secondary team are in the final of the school league and will play Pointe Larue secondary on Saturday. Surely this donation will help boost the morale of the young footballers.
Betsy now plays for Woking in the Conference National league, which is the fifth tier of English football. Betsy started his career with Woking but went on to make a name for himself with Fulham where he became part of the squad who earned promotions in 1999 and 2002, making the club a Premier League team.
Betsy moved to Barnsley in 2002 and made 94 league appearances, wrapping up 15 goals in a two-year period with The Tykes before moving to Hartlepool United then on to Oldham Athletic and then Wycombe Wanderers. In 2007 he signed for Bristol City and while there spent loan spells with Yeovil Town and Walsall. A year after signing for City he moved on again to Southend United before returning to Wycombe following a loan spell. In 2012 he re-signed for Woking.
Betsy was once described by the great Kevin Keegan as “one of the best young players he had seen at his age”, when the manager signed him for Fulham in 1998. Prior to that, Betsy was named as conference Player of the Year and that prompted Keegan to sign him from Woking.

Betsy is also studying for a BA Honors Degree in professional sports writing and broadcasting at Staffordshire University.
In 2011, he was part of the team who won the gold medal at the 8th Indian Ocean Island Games on home soil.

Access to hotels and beaches for all, says Minister St Ange
25-July-2013
The call was made in a declaration by Tourism and Culture Minister Alain St Ange in the National Assembly on Tuesday following written and verbal complaints received by his ministry that people are being denied access to hotels.
The issue of access to beaches had already been addressed by the ministries responsible for tourism, land use and environment, and Minister St Ange took the opportunity on Tuesday to remind tourism establishments and property owners of existing laws.
The tourism minister said that his ministry is very concerned about the situation which he said should not become a habit and common practice.
He reminded that the law makes provisions for hotels with public license to give access and offer service to all clients including Seychellois, save for private functions and facilities reserved to residents and for which one has to check in, as long as he/she respects the in-house regulations.
Otherwise hotels will have to change their license to one of a private club whereby they will not be allowed to sell anything to tourists, he insisted.
“Discrimination is not acceptable and will not be tolerated,” the minister said, adding that “Seychellois should also be able to enjoy facilities available in his or her own country”.
In an effort to find a solution to the problem, Minister St Ange said that his office has sent the declaration to all hotels and is working in close collaboration with them, the Seychelles Licensing Authority (SLA) and the immigration department.
He informed the Assembly that his ministry is encouraging all hotels to have at least one Seychellois security personnel who knows the local culture and who can better greet clients at the entrance gate.
For persons whose rights are not respected by hotels and who are treated with disrespect by hotel staff, the minister is asking that they complain to the tourism ministry in writing, stating all possible details of the incident, including the persons involved.
He stressed that this is important as in case the culprit is a foreigner, his or her gainful occupational permit (GOP) can be revoked even if the company’s employee is the hotel’s general manager.
On the issue of beach access, Minister St Ange said that as present laws allow access to beaches by sea but restrict access where there is no public access and properties cannot be trespassed, a concerted effort should be made to address the loophole in the law and get property owners to provide public access to all beaches.
For new tourism establishments, the minister said building permission should include a condition which ensures provision of beach access.
The tourism minister has also said that with the collaboration of other partners, his ministry is currently addressing other problems with hotels, such as the issue of salary for local workers.

Farming, fishing get big boost
25-July-2013

Minister Sinon addressing the gathering at the launch of the Clissa project

“Together we can make this quantum leap for the benefit of farmers, fishermen and the Seychellois people. Let’s revive our agriculture and fishing industries,” Minister for Natural Resources Peter Sinon said when he launched the Competitive Local Innovations for Small-Scale Agriculture (Clissa) project earlier this week.
The Clissa project is being financed by an Ifad loan of US $3 million and an additional US $282,000 from the Seychelles government. It provides credit to the small farmers to help revive farming and fishing activities here. 
The credit will be managed by a financial institution to ensure that other components of the project like small civil works and infrastructure, technical assistance, capacity building and training are achieved with the aim of improving the current condition for small scale farmers, including home gardeners.
Also present at the ceremony held at the School of Education auditorium were Minister for Social Affairs, Community Development and Sports Vincent Meriton, Minister for Education Macsuzy Mondon and Minister for Employment and Human Resource Development Idith Alexander. 
Caroline Bidault, the new country manager for the eastern and southern Africa, was also present to witness the official launch of the Clissa project, as well as local farmers and fishermen and representatives of non-governmental bodies.

It will address availability of inputs, introduce appropriate technologies and provide agricultural infrastructure like roads to farm-gates, irrigation programmes among others.
Minister Sinon added that the “new funds injected in this sector shall ensure that together we can significantly improve the status of nutritious, safe and home-grown food security and sufficiency for Seychelles”. 
Ms Bidault pointed out that “Clissa seeks to contribute to the revival of the agricultural sector; strengthening small scale artisanal fisheries and the promotion of prolong micro-organised development”.
Minister Sinon, natural resources principal secretary Michael Nalletamby, special adviser Antoine-Marie Moustache and Ms Bidault answered questions raised by the members present in order to shed light on Clissa’s role and how they (famers and fishermen) will benefit from it.

Africa’s regulators approve Absa-Barclays transaction, deal clears final hurdle
25-July-2013
A press communiqué from Barclays Banks Seychelles writes that the necessary conditions have been fulfilled (or, where appropriate, waived) to conclude the combination of Barclays Africa and Absa, including regulatory approvals in Seychelles, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
The approval includes Barclays Bank Seychelles Limited, following regulatory approval for the transaction to go ahead by the Central Bank of Seychelles and other authorities in Seychelles.
Commenting on the development, Absa group chief executive and Barclays chief executive Africa Maria Ramos said: “This is a momentous achievement for Barclays in Africa. The deal marks an extraordinary milestone that sets us firmly on course to become the ‘Go-To’ bank on the continent. It means we can accelerate Africa’s true global potential by supporting the development of capital markets and providing a greater range of financial services on the continent.”
Reflecting the enlarged group’s pan-Africa focus, Absa Group Limited will change its name to Barclays Africa Group Limited on August 2, 2013. The Absa brand will still be used in South Africa while the strong Barclays brand will remain elsewhere, including in Seychelles.
Barclays will hold 62.3% of Barclays Africa Group Limited through the issue of 129.5 million ordinary shares by Absa, representing a value of approximately R18.3 billion.  Barclays Bank Kenya Limited and Barclays Bank Botswana will continue to be listed on their respective stock exchanges.
Barclays Seychelles managing director Rakesh Jha said: “We are excited about the opportunities that this development brings to the growth of our business in the market, particularly the ability for us to offer our clients and customers the best of both Barclays and Absa services and products in Seychelles.”
As previously announced, Egypt and Zimbabwe are not included in this transaction, the communiqué adds, but they will remain an integral part of the African business and Barclays will continue to run them on an operational basis.
Maria Ramos concludes: “We have created one of the leading banking groups in Africa, strengthening our geographic footprint and increasing our growth opportunities on the continent. By capitalising on our heritage and seizing the opportunity in some of the fastest growing economies in the world, we are well positioned to win in Africa.”

New enterprise unit aims to cut through red tape for businesses
25-July-2013
 
The principal secretary of the new department, Marise Berlouis, said that it was her mandate to oversee the creation of the new authority by September 1, which would have wide-ranging regulatory powers, including environmental, health and transport.
Industry now falls under the new department, a sector that Ms Berlouis acknowledged as a vital part of the economy.
She described the industrial estate at Providence as a “mess”, saying it had been allowed to deteriorate from an industrial estate into a second town.
Major upheavals at several other government agencies may also be on the cards as the DEDBI tries to make the business environment for entrepreneurs in Seychelles more welcoming and less bureaucratic. Ms Berlouis was speaking during a meeting with representatives from the Seychelles Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) yesterday.
The principal secretary confirmed that the department was due to receive a million US dollar grant in January next year from the African Development Bank to ease business training and technical help for small and medium-sized enterprises in Seychelles, and said she was seeking to create a partnership with the SCCI for the training and mentorship of entrepreneurs.
Ms Berlouis has previously held executive roles at the Seychelles Licensing Authority (SLA), Small Enterprise Promotion Agency (Senpa), as well as being special advisor in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Industry, which has now been re-named the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR).
The chairman of the SCCI, Marco Francis, welcomed the department’s engagement with the private sector and congratulated Ms Berlouis on her appointment to the role.
He said the SCCI would support the department’s efforts to eliminate bureaucracy and other obstacles encountered by entrepreneurs and offered the chamber’s support for mentorship and training initiatives.
During a lively discussion between Ms Berlouis and the SCCI board, she revealed that sweeping changes to the mandate of Senpa were likely to be imminent, including the widening of its umbrella to include small and medium-sized enterprises of all types of industries.
Senpa was created in 2004, after the insolvency of the Seychelles Industrial Corporation (Sidec) in the same year, with the aim to promote and support small and medium-sized handicraft enterprises and cottage industries.
Ms Berlouis expressed scathing criticism at the way Senpa was currently being operated, citing major organisational weaknesses.
“Senpa needs looking at very urgently,” said Ms Berlouis. “The department there is not a very good role model of doing business in itself, so it’s not very capable of showing other people how to do business.”
“They need capacity building. They need a proper audit of what they have there,” she said. “[Their claims that they have] ten thousand cottage industries is not true, so we need to go out there and find out exactly what is going on in that area.”
“The Small Business Financial Agency (SBFA) needs to also have a proper database, which we will now help them to do, of who owes them money, where the money is, and so on. They don’t have that; they have a pile of files sitting in the corner, so they need to get themselves organised as well.”
SCCI vice-chairman Dolor Ernesta said he believed the focus of entrepreneurial training should be placed on school-leavers and drop-outs to ensure they did not slip through the cracks and end up on the fringes of society.
“In terms of mentoring, I believe we are picking the wrong people to mentor young entrepreneurs,” said Mr Ernesta. “We need people who have practical experience of entrepreneurship, so that the young entrepreneurs can pick the brains of their mentors.”

China and Seychelles create stimulus for further consultation
25-July-2013
 
The agreement provides for the setting up of a mechanism that will increase coordination and communication between the two foreign ministries on matters of bilateral, regional and international issues of common interest.
The signing took place following a bilateral meeting with the new Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi.
Mr Wang, who was appointed to the post earlier this year, noted that the new Chinese leadership would continue to cherish the partnership with Seychelles.
Minister Adam also met Yang Jiechi, member of the State Council, who is also the former Foreign Minister.
In his opening remarks to both officials, Minister Adam conveyed the condolence and solidarity of President Michel and the government and people of Seychelles following the devastating earthquake that hit the city of Dingxi earlier this week.
In his meetings with both Mr Wang and Mr Yang, Minister Adam, who is on his first official trip to China, discussed existing, as well as new areas of partnership with China such as in marine research and security, aquaculture, a code share agreement and direct air link between the two countries, community based projects, the opening of a new consulate general in Shanghai, extension of cooperation between the Seychelles Broadcasting Cooperation and CCTV, as well as the possible increase of scholarship programmes.
For his part, the Chinese Foreign Minister took the opportunity to reaffirm China’s support in furthering the “all round” cooperation which exists between the two countries, urging Seychelles to submit a five- year plan to the Chinese government to ensure a sustainable footing in the demarche for continued cooperation.
Minister Adam expressed the Seychelles government’s appreciation for the various projects China has successfully implemented over the years, notably China’s assistance in several major infrastructure projects such as the newly opened Palais de Justice and the Anse Royale Hospital, as well as the second phase of the Les Mamelles housing project among others.
Reiterating Seychelles’ appreciation for the historic full visa waiver agreement signed in May this year between the two countries, Minister Adam stated that, “Seychelles is proud to be the first African country to sign a full visa waiver agreement with China. It represents the strength of partnership between our two countries”.
Minister Adam described the signing of the visa waiver agreement as a new chapter in the relations between the two countries.
Describing Seychelles as the “Pearl in the Indian Ocean”, Mr Yang affirmed that while the Seychellois tourists will undoubtedly increase in China, likewise, more Chinese tourists will also be encouraged to travel to Seychelles, adding that China has much to learn from Seychelles in tourism.
During the discussions the two foreign ministers expressed the support of their governments to work together for the common interest of world stability.
Minister Wang reiterated China’s support to continue developing warm and friendly relations with big and small countries alike in the interest of international security, adding that China will continue to support developing countries like Seychelles.
The Chinese Foreign Minister also praised Seychelles for its bold step in carrying out economic reforms, adding, “without reform it is difficult to have sustainable development”.
Discussions also focused on the expansion of Chinese assistance to Seychelles in maritime cooperation especially in Seychelles efforts against piracy. The Chinese Foreign Minister underscored Seychelles tremendous efforts in combating piracy, noting that Seychelles position as an island nation, occupies an important position in the ocean. To this effect both Seychelles and China agreed in stepping up efforts to work together for the common interest of international peace and security.

Minister hails Kenya Airways’ added flight to Seychelles
25-July-2013
“We really appreciate the flights and the visibility that Kenya Airways brings for both inbound and outbound flights, and adding a new flight to cope with demand, even if it is temporary, provides positive benefits for us, not only for our aviation sector but our tourism sector as well,” said Minister Morgan.
It should be noted that the minister recently convened a stakeholders meeting, which was as well attended by the Minister for Finance, Trade and Investment and the Minister for Tourism and Culture, to discuss the challenges faced by the aviation and tourism sector following the announcement that Qatar Airways would be suspending its service to Seychelles as from September 1, 2013.
A follow-up meeting with stakeholders from the tourism trade and key businesses is now being planned so as to maximise and better identify key synergies.
“The meeting was a great start and afforded all the opportunity to discuss openly the market conditions and Seychelles as a destination. It is clear that more needs to be done to fill up the seats of those airlines flying into Seychelles and we simply have to improve upon the product on offer and make it attractive with more value-added services,” said Minister Morgan.
The minister noted the exemplary service of Lemuria Resort on Praslin, which was recently recognised by CNN Travel as being one of the top ten resorts in Africa for golfing. 
According to the CNN report, Africa has over 800 world great golf courses, with over 450 being in South Africa alone.
“This is a great example of a quality product being delivered and combined with the ease of aviation access into Seychelles, makes the offer to would-be visitors more appealing so that they come to Seychelles and enjoy their stay.
“While we are welcoming the Kenya Airways additional flight to our skies, I am pleased to note that our team at the Seychelles Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA) is not wasting any opportunity to continue dialogues with other airlines and encouraging them to come to Seychelles. The chief executive of the SCAA, Gilbert Faure, recently attended the Routes Africa 2013 where he had the opportunity to meet several airline heads, including Turkish Airlines, who we can confirm are committed to flying to Seychelles, following discussions with them,” said Minister Morgan.
Minister Morgan concluded by extending his thanks to the local staff of Kenya Airways for their continued dedication in serving the airline and Seychelles, and as well to Zakiya Vidot who has ably led the team successfully for many years.

24-July-2013

24-July-2013

After meeting with VP Faure, Mrs Al- Hinai met ministers of Finance Pierre Laporte and of Natural Resources and Industry Peter Sinon, Attorney General Ronny Govinden and chief negotiator for Seychelles accession to the WTO Charles Morin.
Speaking to the media after the meeting with VP Faure, Mrs Al-Hinai described the discussions they had as “good and productive”.
She said that the discussion was a follow-up of her last visit in February and of the working party that took place in Geneva in June.
They discussed the result of both meetings and the progress of the accession.
“Seychelles is making substantial and good progress towards accession to the world trade body,” she said.
But she added they also discussed what needs to be done to accelerate the negotiation of the accession of Seychelles.
“Seychelles’ level of commitment is very high and very good towards the accession and it is a good signal to members showing that Seychelles is taking this process seriously,” Mrs Al-Hinai said.
“VP Faure has been a good force for pushing the negotiation forward. And the involvement of the ministers and government has been very good,” Mrs Al-Hinai also added.

Volleyball-Rainbow move to third, Saints lose out
24-July-2013
Rainbow United met Santa West in the only women’s division one match played last weekend and were looking to get a win to move up the table.
It was an easy match for them as they won 3-0 (25-20, 25-17, 25-12) after one hour 41 minutes of play to move up to third place in the league standings on 15 points.
Boasting the same number of points – 16 – as Cascade, Friends lead the table on set difference – +11 (17 for and 6 against) compared to Cascade’s +10 (15 for and 5 against).
In the Kokonet women’s division two league, it was Saints United who went down against Port Glaud. The first two sets were very even with the teams winning one apiece. It was in the third and fourth sets that Port Glaud pressed on the accelerator to win the match on a 3-1 (25-22, 22-25, 25-12, 25-6) score in two hours 8 minutes.
The win has helped Port Glaud move to second place with 22 points, four behind Praslin-based Saints who remain on top despite the loss with 26 points (8 wins and 2 defeats in 10 games).
In other matches, Ephelia Resort claimed their third win of the season on a 3-1 (25-16, 25-22, 19-25, 25-17) score against Island Girls after two hours seven minutes of play and St Louis Bombers had less work to do against Cadettes, finishing the job in 56 minutes and on a 3-0 (25-18, 25-12, 25-18) score.
The win did not change much for either team as Cadettes remain rooted to the bottom and the Bombers are one place above them.
The only men’s division two match played was between Airwaves and Juniors. The encounter went for almost two hours but Airwaves finally managed to grab a 3-1 (22-25, 25-22, 25-21, 25-17) win after coming from a set down. 
Airwaves are now third after this victory with 14 points (two wins and six defeats).
The league leaders are GAP Boyz who have won all their six matches.

Seychelles, Mozambique to boost parliamentary ties
24-July-2013
 
 
This followed a meeting held in Maputo last week between the Speaker of the National Assembly of Seychelles, Dr Patrick Herminie and his counterpart Speaker Veronica Nataniel Macamo Dlovo.
Speaker Herminie was in Mozambique on the invitation of the First Lady of the country, Dr Maria da Luz Dai Guebuza, to address a conference on the role of Speakers of Parliaments in the fight against cervical cancer, a growing public health issue in Africa.
In the meeting with Speaker Macamo Dlovo, both sides agreed that the purpose of such a memorandum would be to mainly share experience and best practices on parliamentary working methods and practices, build institutional capacity and promote collaboration between the two institutions.
Both Speakers observed that their respective democracy is emerging and that they share similar challenges.
The memorandum will be signed in October, when, for the first time ever, the National Assembly of Mozambique will take part in the Conference for Speakers and Presiding Officers of Commonwealth Countries. Mozambique is the only African Commonwealth country which was not a British colony.
In the conference itself, Speaker Herminie called on the world community to shift its paradigm in the fight against cervical cancer.
He noted that this public health problem is a direct result of poverty, family breakdown, early initiation of sex, poor sexual education, unavailability of basic health services and low-class excesses.
 
He expanded on the need for greater political commitment by politicians including parliamentarians in the fight against the crippling poverty that affects many parts of Africa as the first condition to contain this public health affliction.
The conference, which was attended by many Speakers of Parliaments and First Ladies in Africa as well as medical experts, was held in Maputo from July 21-23 and was officially opened by the President of the Republic of Mozambique and Africa’s Goodwill Ambassador for Women and Children’s Health, Armando Emilio Guebuza.

Tripartite partners work on mid-term review of employment strategy
24-July-2013

This is according to the director of International Labour Organisation’s country office, Christian Ntsay, who was speaking at the opening ceremony of a three-day workshop to assess the progress made thus far towards achieving the goals outlined in the Seychelles DWCP, which was signed in 2011.
“The government of Seychelles is considering decent work as a priority in its National Employment Strategy, and the DWCP has been fully mainstreamed into the strategy as a relevant tool to promote decent work,” said Mr Ntsay. “More decent jobs for the men and women of Seychelles: this is the main goal of the DWCP and I hope that this will be achieved upon the end of the programme.”
The participants, who represented government organisations, employers and workers unions, have come together as tripartite partners with the Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development to assess their achievements, the lessons learnt and to give recommendations for the final two years of the programme.
Work on the DWCP first started in 2008 with the drafting committee, comprised of representatives from government, social partners and NGOs. The programme was then signed in November 2011 by then-minister for Education, Employment and Human Resources, Macsuzy Mondon and the ILO.
The principal secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development, Veronique Bresson said the review of the programme was important in order to guide the stakeholders in terms of its future implementation.
“I wish to reiterate that the DWCP is of great relevance to the country and there have been a lot of achievements under that programme,” said Ms Bresson. “For instance, the review of the employment act, the employment policy and the HIV/Aids workplace policy have all been supported under the DWCP.”
Ms Bresson added that the programme had also funded the training of some officials from the Ministry of Labour. A number of technical research projects were also undertaken as part of the activities to advance the decent work agenda.
She added that the organisations present needed to be aware of the programme so that employment priorities could be considered in their future plans and policies.
The workshop is being held at the Berjaya Beau Vallon Bay Resort and Casino.

SPA adds more value to its services at inter-island jetty
24-July-2013

This comes after the Seychelles Ports Authority (SPA), in collaboration with a new private operator, has revamped the facility as part of its business and commercial strategies to add more value to its services.
The revamped passenger terminal building will house a new restaurant, bar and other amenities which will provide commuters and the public in general with more comfort as they travel to Mahé’s  neighbouring islands.
In line with SPA’s request to provide such facilities at convenient hours for passengers and visitors, the restaurant will open from 6.30am until 11pm Monday to Saturday and 9am to 9pm on Sundays.
 
The SPA, through a local public tender, awarded the facility to the new private operator and is satisfied that the upgraded facility, to be opened soon, will provide port users and the public in general with a new service experience at the inter-island jetty.
The new catering service will reinforce the current efforts that are being invested by SPA to upgrade its jetty services on Mahé, Praslin and La Digue.
In addition to the current facility, SPA will soon start the construction of additional seating facilities there to cater for the increasing number of ferry passengers between Mahe and neighbouring islands.
Providing a covered area from the car park to the ferry, this additional facility will also cater for approximately 200 plus pax seating capacity, ticket checking counter, small booths for Destinations Management Companies, and car hire operators. The facility, covering a total of over 300 square metres, will also provide additional sanitary facilities to the existing passenger terminal building. 
Apart from this project, SPA is finalising some technical details in order to start construction, in the near future, of a new state-of-the-art passenger building on Eve Island, Praslin.
Furthermore, the authority is also assessing new ways to improve the comfort of arriving and departing passengers on the La Digue jetty.
Through an open-door policy, SPA welcomes positive criticisms and suggestions, aimed at improving its customer service deliveries. Winner of the 2010 and 2012 Indian Ocean Leading Cruise Port Award, SPA is carrying out an-depth assessment of its services offered both to its local and international passengers, to ensure that it remains the region’s favourite port of calls, as far as passenger service is concerned.
The authority has said it is continually striving to bring more efficiency and value to its clients, by improving the level of comfort and service at all its port terminals.

President visits major development projects
24-July-2013
He was accompanied by the Minister for Finance, Trade and Investment Pierre Laporte, and the Minister for Land Use and Housing, Christian Lionnet.
The President visited the site of a new condominium project on the north coast of Ile Perseverance, where 158 units will be built, which are targeted at young professionals and graduates.

The six blocks, designed by Berlouis Mondon Design Studio, will contain three-bedroom, two-bedroom and one-bedroom apartments with the biggest costing around R1.5 million.
Construction work will start in October this year, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. A first phase is planned for allocation in the third quarter of 2014.
 
"Many young Seychellois professionals and returning graduates complain that they cannot find accommodation in Seychelles that they can afford, and also do not qualify for subsidised government housing allocations,” said President Michel.
“This project will alleviate the demand for housing for young professionals, where they will have the chance to buy their own home for the first time... we want them to stay and contribute to the development of the country, and we will have other projects to encourage them to do so," added the President.

The condominium project will be open to young professionals who are first time buyers, who are either returning graduates, graduates of the University of Seychelles, as well as young professionals without a degree, who fall within the specified income category for the condominium project. This project is a public private partnership with developer Green Island Construction Company, whereby the developer will finance and build the project without the need for government financing through the capital budget.
Minister Lionnet noted that potential leasers will in September be given information about how to go about applying for a condominium and details about the financing scheme.
From Ile Perseverance, President Michel went to the Providence Industrial Estate where he visited Zone 18 where the government is planning to build a Microenterprise Centre, which will house small business, restaurants, warehouses, car service centres, and specialised workshops.

"To develop the economy, you need small business in order to develop the spirit of entrepreneurship, which will grow and develop the economy... they need affordable spaces to develop their businesses, and this centre will allow them to do that.... There has been a lack of affordable work space as rental prices in the country are too high. This will address the situation, and provide small entrepreneurs a chance to flourish and to encourage them to take ownership of the economy," said Mr Michel.
Construction of the government-funded 3,500m2 Microenterprise Centre will start soon, and it is expected to be completed by June 18, 2014.

"It will be another milestone of the government's effort to empower Seychellois entrepreneurs and small businesses to develop their potential and to create wealth for our country," said the President.
President Michel pledged to empower small and medium enterprises during his National Day Address this year.
Minister Lionnet said his ministry is now preparing the land where construction will spring up on zone 18 and will start the tender process in September.
Also present during the visits were MLUH’s principal secretary for project planning and implementation Yves Choppy, and principal secretary for entrepreneurship development and business innovation Maryse Berlouis.

Exchanging internet traffic locally will help the industry to grow, says DICT
23-July-2013

Mr Choppy addressing delegates at the opening of the workshop yesterday

According to the head of the Information Society Division at the African Union Commission (AUC), Moctar Yedaly, this is precisely the reason why accessing online local content in many African countries is often slow and at times unappealing to users. It’s also why Seychelles is one of over 30 African countries identified by the AUC as being in need of a national internet exchange point (IXP).
“Many years ago, if you wanted to travel from one African country to another African, you had to go through a hub outside Africa, like London or France, and go back to Africa,” Mr Yedaly explained.
“The same thing is happening now in terms of internet traffic. The consequence of that is the user will pay the link up and the link down and this makes it very expensive in terms of communication and inefficient in terms of delivery.”
Mr Yedaly said that the AUC had found that $600 million was being paid to outside service providers for communications between African countries per year, a figure which he said could be drastically reduced with the widespread implementation of national and regional IXPs.
In this vein, the Department of Information and Communication Technology (DICT), in collaboration with the AUC and the Internet Society are conducting a two-day best practice capacity building workshop to support the establishment of an IXP in Seychelles.
The workshop, which commenced yesterday at Le Meridien Barbarons hotel, is part of the AU’s African Internet Exchange System (AXIS) project to support the establishment of IXPs across Africa.
The Internet Society, an international, non-profit organisation that provides leadership in internet related standards, education, and policy, has been selected to deliver best practices and hands-on technical workshops in which all internet service providers (ISPs) and stakeholders in Seychelles were invited to take part.
The AXIS project aims at keeping Africa’s internet traffic local to the continent by providing capacity building and technical assistance to facilitate the establishment of IXPs in Africa. As countries establish their own IXPs, internet traffic will be routed locally, creating a downward pressure on costs and stimulating growth in and distribution of local internet content.
As the IXP would need to be built as a bridge between the internet service providers, it would have to be undertaken by the private sector, but the AUC would facilitate technical assistance, project management and also financial assistance for the purchase of infrastructure needed to set up the IXP.
The principal secretary for ICT, Benjamin Choppy, said that the government had always believed the private sector should be the main players of developing the internet industry in Seychelles.
“The possible setting up of a national IXP infrastructure is to be viewed in the same light. We do expect that the private telecommunications sector undertake this, and from the government’s side, we will do as much as possible to facilitate and support it,” he said.
“The primary benefit that I foresee will particularly apply to Seychelles is that the local internet service providers will be able to exchange traffic between local networks more readily by using a common exchange point.”
As a result, said Mr Choppy, it can be expected that there will be local benefits such as the improvement on the speed of access to locally-hosted websites and other interactive services. The latter is regarded a special development now that government is making more use of the internet to make its services and information more accessible to the population.
The end goal of the workshop is to establish a mutual agreement from the participants to establish an IXP. Mr Yedaly said that the common obstacle experienced in trying to convince ISPs to build national exchanges was the natural instinct of the operators to keep their traffic within their own network.
“That mindset of operators keeping the traffic in their own quarters, and then from there sending it back, has to be changed because it doesn’t help them in terms of capacity and it doesn’t make them competitive on price,” Mr Yedaly said.
Speaking on behalf of one of the local ISPs, Kokonet, Bernard Moutia said that he was in favour of the proposed IXP.
“We welcome anything that encourages the development of the internet in Seychelles,” said Mr Moutia. “Kokonet has always taken a position of being forward-looking, and if setting up an internet exchange point is going to encourage that, we support it wholeheartedly.”
The best practice capacity building workshop is the first of two workshops. The second workshop, which focuses on the technical training required to build an IXP, will be planned once the consensus has been reached among the local service providers to build the exchange.
